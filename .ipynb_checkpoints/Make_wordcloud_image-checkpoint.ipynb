      "'u.s. presidents george w. bush and barack obama, when first elected, both thought they could establish a rapport with russian leader vladimir putin and dramatically improve u.s.-russian relations.', 'their appraisal of putin swiftly changed.', 'when asked his impression of putin after his first face-to-face meeting, george w. bush said, “i looked the man in the eye. i found him very straightforward and trustworthy – i was able to get a sense of his soul.” obama, eight years later, openly sought a reset in relations only to see his hopes dashed finally with russia’s annexation of the ukrainian peninsula crimea in 2014.', 'joe biden, who as obama’s vice president supported the reset strategy, is unlikely to follow the example of his predecessors, say former diplomats and analysts. biden indicated as much during his presidential campaign, saying at a cnn town hall last month, “i believe russia is an opponent, i really do.”', 'in contrast, he called china “a competitor, a serious competitor.”', 'during the presidential campaign, biden sought to differentiate himself from president donald trump regarding russia, accusing his republican rival of being soft on putin.', 'trump and his aides pushed back, with the president saying in august, “the last person russia wants to see in office is donald trump because nobody’s been tougher on russia than i have.”', 'early last month, biden criticized his opponent for remaining silent on the poisoning of russian opposition leader alexei navalny, which he bluntly blamed on the moscow government.', '“once again, the kremlin has used a favorite weapon — an agent from the novichok class of chemicals — in an effort to silence a political opponent,” he said. “it is the mark of a russian regime that is so paranoid that it is unwilling to tolerate any criticism or dissent.”', 'but candidates can say one thing during a campaign and do something else once in office; sometimes they have little choice because of circumstances or the course of events. will a president joe biden pursue as muscular an approach to russia as he has suggested?', \"“i don't think biden is going to fall head over heels to butter up putin,” said david kramer, who was an assistant secretary of state in the administration of george w. bush. “moscow has continued with a disinformation campaign against him, and so i don't think he's going to extend a hand and say, ‘let's make nice,’” added kramer, now a fellow at the mccain institute, a foreign policy think tank based in washington.\", '“i mean, no reset. i don’t think he’s going to try anything like 2009,” kramer said in reference to obama’s failed reset policy. kramer thinks biden will have to focus largely on domestic issues, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact.', \"“and to the extent he is able to focus on foreign policy, russia should not be at the high end of the priority list,” he told voa. although he added, “you can't ignore it. and it is a factor in a number of problems we face. i think he's going to have to devote his limited time when it comes to foreign policy to work with countries that are ready to solve problems.” by that he means shoring up america’s transatlantic alliance.\", 'biden and putin have met — without much cordiality. in a 2011 interview with ', ' magazine, biden said at one meeting he told the russian leader, “i’m looking into your eyes, and i don’t think you have a soul.”', 'biden continued: “he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said: ‘we understand one another.’”', 'aside from the lack of personal rapport, analysts say any effort to reset relations would be complicated by economic sanctions on russia, imposed by both the obama and trump administrations. the measures will leave biden with little room to maneuver and are unlikely to be lifted while western powers believe russia is mounting cyberattacks against them.', 'former western diplomats say antagonism is likely to persist between washington and moscow as long as the kremlin seeks to undermine western democratic institutions.', 'last week, a former top security adviser to british prime minister boris johnson, mark sedwill, revealed that britain has launched a series of covert cyber-based attacks on russian leaders and their interests to “impose a price greater than one they might have expected” for their cyber-offensive against the west.', 'other allied powers, including the u.s. are doing so, too, say western intelligence officials in what is becoming a “like-for-like” cyber-conflict with the kremlin in the so-called “gray space,” the gap between normal state relations and armed conflict.', 'the u.s. and other western powers are in conflict with russia on a range of issues — from the 2014 annexation of crimea to the pro-moscow agitation in east ukraine, from russia’s backing of syria’s president bashar al-assad to the 2018 attempted assassination in salisbury, england, of former russian double agent sergei skripal.', 'heather williams of britain’s chatham house expects a biden administration to focus on two key areas: restoring arms control and strengthening nato to check russian adventurism.', '“on the one hand, the u.s. must maintain a strong deterrent and restore credibility with its allies. at the same time, it must pursue arms control and other risk reduction opportunities,” she said.', 'in the final days of the presidential election the kremlin appeared to be hedging its bets on who might win.', 'republican campaigners, as well as president trump, had been hurling corruption charges at biden’s son hunter over his service on the board of an energy company in ukraine and business dealings with china.', 'but putin dodged an opportunity to amplify the allegations against hunter biden, saying, “yes, in ukraine he had or maybe still has a business. it doesn’t concern us. it concerns the americans and the ukrainians. i don’t see anything criminal about this.”', 'the russian leader has also sought to highlight possible common ground with biden — especially over nuclear arms control.', 'putin called this month for the last existing nuclear arms control pact between russia and the u.s. to be saved, proposing to extend the new start treaty that’s set to expire in february. “it would be extremely sad if the treaty ceases to exist,” he said.', 'the treaty was signed in 2010 by barack obama and then-russian president dmitry medvedev. the pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.', 'during his long career in the senate, biden was a champion of nuclear arms control and he has promised to seek to extend the new start treaty, saying he would likely accept a russian offer to extend it for five years.']['\\n', '\\n', 'as a candidate, joe biden said he would reverse many of the foreign-policy initiatives of the trump administration, such as withdrawing the united states from international agreements, and work to repair the transatlantic relationship that he contends has been the key to stability in europe over the past 75 years.', 'he has said he would take a tougher stand on russia, expressed strong support for ukraine, and would rejoin the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran, if tehran holds up its end of the deal.', 'a former vice president and senator who served nearly 50 years in washington, biden believes the united states can best tackle global threats by leading alliances of democratic states.', 'he said he would take \"immediate steps\" upon entering office to strengthen alliances \"and once more have america lead the world.\"', 'however, biden will be faced with major domestic problems in a deeply divided country -- including the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, racial tension, and growing inequality -- that may prompt him to put his foreign-policy initiatives on the back burner, analysts say.', 'analysts have said it could take the biden administration several months to put together its entire foreign policy team and set more specific priorities.', 'biden has said he would seek to repair transatlantic ties, which he asserts president donald trump has damaged by repeatedly criticizing the european union and nato, slapping tariffs on some european goods, and withdrawing from international agreements.', 'in contrast to trump, who in 2016 called nato \"obsolete,\" biden has called it the \"most effective political-military alliance in modern history\" and said it must remain strоng while adapting to new kinds of threats from russia.', '\"to counter russian aggression, we must keep the alliance\\'s military capabilities sharp while also expanding its capacity to take on nontraditional threats, such as weaponized corruption, disinformation, and cybertheft,\" he wrote in the journal ', ' earlier in 2020, in an article setting out his positions on a range of issues.', 'biden has said he would take a tougher stand against russian president vladimir putin, and has called moscow an \"opponent\" as well as the biggest \"threat\" to the security of the united states today.', 'he has criticized the kremlin for actions including the seizure of crimea and for its role in the war between kyiv and russia-backed separatists in ukraine’s donbas region. he has also accused it of interfering in u.s. elections and of being behind attacks on russian journalists and civil society leaders. trump rarely criticized the kremlin.', '\"unlike trump, i\\'ll defend our democratic values and stand up to autocrats like putin,\" biden said in a tweet in august.', \"he has also threatened to punish moscow if it interfered in the 2020 election and rejected trump's idea of inviting russia back into the group of seven (g7) leading industrialized countries.\", '\"we must impose real costs on russia for its violations of international norms and stand with russian civil society, which has bravely stood up time and again against...putin\\'s kleptocratic authoritarian system,\" he wrote in the foreign affairs article.', 'biden supports the cancelation of the kremlin-backed nord stream 2 pipeline to carry natural gas from russia to germany. opponents of the pipeline say it would deprive ukraine of significant transit fees from russia and increase european reliance on russian energy exports.', \"biden, who was obama's point man on ukraine as vice president, has expressed strong support for ukraine's independence and integration with europe and has backed sending lethal weapons to kyiv to help it battle the russian-backed separatists.\", \"biden has said he would extend new start, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with russia, while pursuing negotiations on a new pact. new start, which imposes limits on the two countries' strategic nuclear arsenals, expires in february but can be extended by up to five years by mutual agreement.\", \"the trump administration has rejected moscow's proposal to prolong new start with no additional conditions, as well as an offer for a one-year extension, and has not reached an agreement on its extension. biden argues that the pact is beneficial to u.s. security and should be extended while a new agreement is sought.\", \"while biden's positions on putin and russia's actions suggest that tensions between washington and moscow will remain tense and could potentially worsen once he takes office, arms control is one of a handful of issues that analysts say could present a platform for productive negotiations between the united states and the kremlin. \", 'biden has said that he would have the united states rejoin the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran, which curbed the country’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief -- if tehran moves back into compliance with its terms.', \"iran violated the terms of the agreement with global powers after trump withdrew the united states from the deal known as the jcpoa in 2018 and imposed sanctions on tehran. the sanctions have hurt iran's economy but not promoted it to seek a new deal.\", 'biden has said he would work with the other powers involved -- britain, france, germany, russia, and china, as well as the eu -- to amend aspects of the agreement once iran is back in compliance.', '\"with our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal\\'s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern,\" such as human rights violations and the jailing of foreigners, biden said.', 'biden said he would bring u.s. troops home from afghanistan -- almost 20 years after the united states led an invasion to drive the taliban extremist group from power following the september 11 attacks in 2001 -- and leave in place only a small contingent of special forces who would carry out counterterrorism missions.', 'biden opposed the large buildup of u.s. troops in afghanistan while serving as vice president from 2009 to 2017.', 'barring substantial developments before his inauguration on january 20, he will inherit a historic but fragile peace process that the trump administration set in motion by reaching a political deal with the taliban in february 2020 that paved the road for peace talks between the militants and the u.s.-backed afghan government.', 'biden has said he will work with u.s. allies to strengthen democracies around the world and push back on creeping authoritarianism. he has expressed concern over what is widely seen as a rollback of democracy in some nato member states, including poland and hungary.', '\"during my first year in office, the united states will organize and host a global \\'summit for democracy\\' to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the free world. it will bring together the world\\'s

adapted their strategies to deal with the new environment. russia’s increased efforts have had decidedly mixed results.', 'three factors were evident when the soviet union collapsed and continue today, narrowing russian policy options in the region.', 'armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia are all radically different, with varying attitudes toward russia and moscow’s rule throughout the imperial and soviet eras. for centuries, armenia has sought russia’s protection against turkey and iran, which ruled most of the armenian historic homelands.', ' this security concern was paramount in the immediate aftermath of the soviet collapse: the soviet army had disappeared, leaving the turkish third army as the most potent military force in the wider region. for its part, post-soviet russia views armenia as its closest friend in the region. a large and influential armenian diaspora in russia has maintained those positive feelings.', 'azerbaijani elites, russified by the oil boom of the late nineteenth century, have largely been friendly to russia. thanks to former president heydar aliyev—who rose through the ranks of the soviet kgb and neither feared nor hated the post-soviet rulers of russia—a generally positive attitude toward russia survived the nationalisms of the years immediately following the soviet collapse. though post-soviet russia was initially suspicious of the expansion of turkish and western influence in azerbaijan, russia has since forged close energy relations with turkey. in the early period, these commercial relations took precedence in the russia-turkey relationship. more recently, as detailed later in the paper, the increasing ambiguity of russian-turkish relations has complicated russia’s relations with azerbaijan.', 'armenia and azerbaijan have incorporated friendly relations with russia into a wider strategy: former armenian foreign minister vartan oskanian described it as a multivectoral approach, in which “foreign policy vectors point in different directions.”', ' it entails seeking close relations with and assistance from powers other than russia, primarily the united states and the european union (eu). large armenian diasporas in the united states and france have aided this endeavor. in contrast, a poor record on democracy and human rights, as well as the armenian diaspora’s efforts in the united states, have hobbled azerbaijan. in the united states, congressional legislation blocked most assistance to azerbaijan until waiver authority was granted in 2001 in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks and azerbaijan’s subsequent role in assisting u.s. antiterrorism efforts elsewhere.', 'in georgia, nationalism remains centered on the rejection of russia. since the massacre of unarmed civilians by soviet troops in the capital, tbilisi, in 1989 and the post-independence presidency of former soviet dissident—and extreme nationalist—zviad gamsakhurdia, georgian society has generally come to view russia as a usurping occupier. february 25—the day the red army invaded tbilisi in 1921—is still observed annually as soviet occupation day. georgians explain away decades of fawning over the “occupiers” as one ambassador did: “for all those years that the russians ruled us, we told them we loved them. and they actually believed us.” georgian warlords deposed gamsakhurdia in january 1992 and installed former soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze as a weak figurehead. his tenure as president involved a constant renegotiation of his powers to gain ascendancy over those warlords. in the early 1990s, still at his weakest vis-à-vis the warlords and pressured by russian support for abkhaz and ossetian separatism, he tried to harness, not reverse, the extreme nationalism of his predecessor’s supporters, especially those displaced from abkhazia by russian-backed separatists.', 'for their part, russians have acted as emotionally as the georgians, seeing georgia’s aspirations toward the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) and the eu as the betrayal of its once advantageous position within moscow’s empire. during one regularly occurring period of heightened tensions, a normally calm senior russian diplomat asked, “when the soviet union was ruled by people named jughashvili, orjonikidze, and beria, just who was occupying whom?” after the september 11, 2001, attacks, as u.s. troops were arriving in georgia to train georgians in counterterrorism, an embittered russian general, recalling the old times of russian officers’ warm reception in georgia over countless song-and-wine-filled ', ' banquets, said, “the americans think they will teach the georgians to fight. in reality, the georgians will teach the americans to sing.”', 'russia cannot deal with armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia in isolation because the countries’ own relations with one another are dense and fraught with tension and conflict. most salient is the karabakh conflict, over which armenians and azerbaijanis have shed so much blood since 1987. both sides appeal to russia for support and view russian amity toward the other side as a betrayal. in the early years, russia tried to profit from the conflict, clandestinely providing weaponry and mercenaries to both sides. in 1992 and 1993, russians backed two coups to install puppets in azerbaijan, but both backfired. in 1992, former azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov’s attempt to return from moscow was thwarted by the nationalist azerbaijan popular front. and in 1993, surat huseynov’s revolt against the popular front was hijacked by aliyev, who took power for himself alone.', ' thereafter, russia stepped back in the region. since brokering a ceasefire in the karabakh conflict in 1994, moscow has limited its interventions to trying (unsuccessfully) to get the sides to agree to a russia-led peacekeeping force of the sort moscow installed to control the abkhazia, south ossetia, and transdniestria separatist conflicts. russia remains a supplier of weaponry to both sides, and every major arms sale to one provokes protests from the other. because azerbaijan’s oil revenues expanded, it has been able to diversify its defense procurements, but armenia remains dependent on russia for arms and security guarantees.', 'georgia is closely intertwined with both armenia and azerbaijan. there are large armenian and azerbaijani minorities in georgia (in separatist abkhazia, armenians actually outnumber the abkhaz). despite initial nationalist difficulties in borchaly, an azerbaijani-inhabited section of georgia, georgian-azerbaijani relations have been good almost since georgia’s independence—largely thanks to a reconciliation of convenience between two soviet-era rivals, eduard shevardnadze and heydar aliyev. aliyev needed georgia to enable the western transit of azerbaijan’s hydrocarbon exports and the import of western goods from turkey. shevardnadze needed azerbaijan to secure oil and gas pipelines to provide both transit royalties and strategic importance to the west.', ' he also needed aliyev to help ensure that the large azerbaijani population of georgia reliably voted for shevardnadze’s political grouping, the citizens union.', 'georgian-armenian relations have been trickier. a portion of the armenian population in georgia is concentrated in javakheti, near a large soviet (later russian) military base that fueled the region’s economy until it was closed in 2007. from 1992 to 1993, the javakhk armenians sought independence, apparently with russian encouragement. but armenia’s only transit routes to russia and the west lay through georgia, as the karabakh conflict had closed armenia’s borders with turkey and azerbaijan, so the government of then armenian president levon ter-petrosyan tamped down javakhk separatism. relations between the two countries grew closer after mikheil saakashvili came to the presidency in georgia in 2004, and they have remained friendly under subsequent leaders.', 'to this day, russian policy in the south caucasus is intertwined with the north caucasus—to which russia has devoted the blood and treasure of generations and which post-soviet russia sees as key to the integrity of the russian state. russia’s domestic security concerns have intruded on the south caucasus in a number of areas.', 'as russian power ebbed away at the end of the soviet era, the russian army—for the first time in centuries—no longer wielded the decisive force in the region. the turkish third army was the most powerful military in the region, and locals adapted to the strategic effects. russia threw its diminished resources into the caucasus to suppress the first chechen rebellion—and met defeat. russia’s subsequent remilitarization of the region, and its demands to adapt the conventional armed forces in europe treaty to allow for greater freedom of movement in the flank, stemmed from its perceived need to redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence in the region.', ' to address russia’s moves to adapt the treaty, azerbaijan and georgia allied with moldova and ukraine to form what later solidified into the organization for democracy and economic development (known simply as the guam).', 'ossetians, ethno-linguistically and religiously different from their neighbors, have been russia’s principal allies in the north caucasus for two centuries. as russia dealt with a host of ethnic nationalisms in the first years after the soviet collapse, including chechen separatism and later an armed islamist movement, north ossetia gained strategic importance to, and leverage with, russian leadership. it has used that leverage to ensure robust russian support for south ossetian separatism from georgia.', 'likewise, other ethnic groups in the mountains of the north caucasus (for example, the chechens, kabardians, and cherkes) saw in abkhaz separatism from georgia the validation of their own ethnic nationalisms. with russian facilitation, many so-called volunteers made their way to abkhazia to join the separatist war against georgia from 1992 to 1993. among the most effective of these was the chechen shamil basayev, who was later an archnemesis of the russians but their ally in that struggle.', 'during the second chechen war, fighters and their families took refuge in georgia’s pankisi gorge, which was effectively outside the georgian government’s control. russian president boris yeltsin called shevardnadze in november 1999 to demand the reinstatement of russian border troops in georgia and passage for russian military units through georgia to attack pankisi from the south. shevardnadze stalled and then called on the americans to dissuade yeltsin. later, after the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the united states sent troops to train the georgians to restore security in pankisi, forestalling russian actions there. even worse, from the russian point of view, shevardnadze made a deal with ruslan gelayev, a chechen commander sheltering in the pankisi gorge, to launch an attack on abkhaz-held territory in 2001. the attack failed, but the russian authorities viewed this series of events as proof that georgia was treacherous and untrustworthy.', 'lastly, azerbaijan shares a long border and considerable ethnic overlap with russia’s dagestan autonomous republic, where salafist proselytizing made extensive inroads in the 1990s. after some years, a full-fledged islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked up with the remains of the armed chechen nationalist movement, which also fell under salafist influence. when attacks began on authorities in dagestan, security cooperation with azerbaijan gained importance for russian internal security.', 'the stage was thus set early on for a consistent—even static—russian policy toward the south caucasus: an economy-of-force balancing act to preserve russia’s traditional friendship and strategic alliance with armenia without harming russia’s economic and security relationship with azerbaijan; and a constant, emotional, and ever-deepening hostility toward georgia.', 'russia views the international arena as a series of camps, each centered by a power whose greatness is confirmed by possessing a camp.', ' russia has been keen to ensure that the new nations forged out of former soviet republics remain in its camp and has formed multinational institutions to cement those relations.', 'initially, russia had hopes that the commonwealth of independent states (cis), formed when the soviet union broke up, might fill the bill. azerbaijan and armenia joined the cis at its inception in 1991. but it was not until 1993 that georgia’s president shevardnadze—under russian military pressure in support of abkhaz separatism and facing a rebellion by ousted former president gamsakhurdia—reluctantly acceded. in 2008, georgia withdrew from the cis after the country’s defeat in the russo-georgian war. with the cis having little influence, russia put forward two other institutions to accomplish the task.', 'the collective security treaty, originally signed in 1992, became the collective security treaty organization (csto) in 2002, designed as a counterweight to nato. armenia joined to relieve its security concerns with regard to turkey; azerbaijan and georgia did not.', 'the eurasian customs union, officially formed in 2000 but active from 2010 onward, also included armenia but not azerbaijan or georgia. in 2014, russia turned the customs union into the eurasian economic union (eaeu), intended as a mirror image of the eu. moscow’s ongoing attempts to equate the two organizations on the international stage has had significant effects on the caucasus, as noted later in this paper.', 'azerbaijan was able to avoid joining russia’s so-called camp thanks to its independent oil revenues, which have grown for both azerbaijan and other post-soviet caspian littoral states. in the early 1990s, moscow’s ability to project power was low and russia could only protest ineffectually when littoral countries signed hydrocarbon extraction contracts in the absence of an international agreement to define national rights in the caspian.', ' azerbaijan, kazakhstan, and turkmenistan brought in western energy majors without fearing russia’s reaction (azerbaijan signed its first major contract in 1993). the status of the caspian was not codified even preliminarily until 2018, and to this day, no treaty covers exploitation of the seabed.', ' russia could not fight ’em, so it joined ’em, settling for sharing in the profits from hydrocarbon development and transit.', 'for a time in the mid-1990s, the united states and russia maneuvered against one another through their respective support of pipelines. the united states heavily promoted the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc) pipeline as an alternative to a russian monopoly on hydrocarbon transit to the west. however, u.s. doctrine demanded that the pipeline be commercially viable in its own right, and the united states refused to put resources into boosting that viability. recognizing this, russia banked on the oil majors’ desire to save money by transporting the oil by tanker across the black sea and through the turkish straits. but when then bp chair john browne visited istanbul and inspected the narrow bosphorus passage, he decided the route was too risky and threw the weight of the oil majors behind btc.', 'russia’s closest relationship in the south caucasus remains with armenia, the country most firmly entrenched in russia’s camp. it is frequently called a strategic alliance, and for armenia this is certainly the case as 3,000 russian troops based in its second-largest city, gyumri, form a trip wire against turkish military action.', 'while azerbaijan generally deals with other countries transactionally, another criterion takes precedence: their stance on armenia and the karabakh conflict. this is the trickiest situation for russia to manage: azerbaijan is russia’s largest trading partner in the caucasus, the two countries have important common issues regarding hydrocarbons, and russia sees a strategic aim in keeping azerbaijan out of what it calls the western camp. therefore, while supporting armenia, russia has tried to avoid alienating azerbaijan, including during the recent surge in fighting. until 2010, russia was discreet about its arms sales to armenia to avoid provoking azerbaijan, denying reports of large arms transfers when they surfaced in 2009.', ' more recently, russia has started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry to both sides and has been more open about its balancing. for example, in 2010, russia signed a new lease on its military base in gyumri (extending it to 2044) and agreed to sell s-300 surface-to-air missiles to azerbaijan.', 'as part of this balancing, russia is involved in attempts to mediate between azerbaijan and armenia to resolve the karabakh conflict. since 1995, russia has been a co-chair of the minsk group, a body under the aegis of the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce) and composed of a number of countries interested in brokering peace. in 1997, the united states and france joined russia as co-chairs, and the three countries have conducted all negotiations thereafter without significant input from the other group members. this structure has facilitated russia-west cooperation to keep a politically insoluble problem from flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline states. when dmitry medvedev was president of russia (2008–2012), he poured great efforts into russian peace initiatives, and with french and u.s. assent russia came to dominate the process. as part of this campaign, medvedev also supported the 2008 opening between armenia and turkey, azerbaijan’s closest ally. that rapprochement failed, however, due to opposition from key constituencies on both sides. ultimately, azerbaijan and armenia were not interested in a negotiated solution, and medvedev’s initiative foundered.', 'russia’s relations with georgia quickly went into a downward spiral after the soviet collapse. russia used substantial military force to ensure the survival and then victory of the separatist rebellion in abkhazia and leveraged that and a revolt by gamsakhurdia to force shevardnadze to accept a russian peacekeeping force in western georgia. still hostile, russia backed two attempts, in 1995 and 1998, to assassinate shevardnadze. until the latter attempt, shevardnadze had been trying to play russia and the united states off against each other, but these actions drove shevardnadze squarely into the arms of the united states.', 'the russians loathed shevardnadze for his role in the collapse of the soviet bloc—on one television program, he was reviled as “the ostap bender of the soviet union,” after the con-man protagonist of the classic soviet comic novel ', '. but that feeling paled beside the emotions stoked in the russian leadership by the flamboyant and mercurial mikheil saakashvili, who ousted shevardnadze at the end of 2003 and became president in 2004. in that year, saakashvili also ousted the quasi-independent aslan abashidze from his rule over the autonomous batumi region, which housed a russian military base. also in 2004, tensions flared in south ossetia. russia retaliated over the next few years, banning the import of georgian products, banning flights between russia and georgia, closing the land border between the two countries, and launching an aggressive campaign against ethnic georgians in russia, including russian citizens, their businesses, and their families. in 2007, russia closed off most of north ossetia to foreigners, allowing preparations for war to proceed unseen by the outside world. and in 2008, as tensions flared again in south ossetia, russian troops invaded, defeating georgia’s forces in short order, occupying parts of georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia, and incorporating these conquests into the separatist statelets, which russia shortly thererafter recognized as independent.', ' but the war also brought the expansion of a new competitor’s presence: the small, neutral osce mission was scrapped, and a large new eu monitoring mission was put in its place.', ' despite the limitations placed on that mission, the overall eu presence and commitment sharply increased.', 'putin’s return to the presidency in 2012 came with a more assertive foreign policy. new leaders wholly dependent on russia were installed in the separatist entities russia supported, including south ossetia and abkhazia, replacing long-established leaders who were pro-russian but possessed their own independent power bases. more importantly, russia began to treat the european union—not just nato—as a strategic rival intent on taking over parts of what medvedev had called russia’s sphere of “', '.” five years earlier, that view had been restricted to the ', ', or senior officers of the hard power ministries (primarily the military, internal affairs, and security services); after putin’s return to the presidency, it became russia’s official policy.', 'the ukrainian crisis of 2013–2014 began with putin pressuring both ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and armenian president serzh sargsyan into repudiating the eu association agreements they had signed and instead joining the nascent russia-centric eaeu. the pressure on sargsyan included a putin visit to azerbaijan’s capital, baku, to discuss arms sales. yanukovych’s caving to putin’s pressure triggered the revolution of dignity in ukraine and his eventual downfall. sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequences. he explained to the nation that security concerns necessitated joining the russian-led organization—that only russia could safeguard armenia from its neighbors. however, after rejecting the eu, sargsyan immediately tried to placate it. negotiations eventually restarted on a trade agreement, and in 2017, armenia signed a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with the eu.', 'after a few protests, armenians fell in line with sargsyan’s capitulation to putin’s wishes: they assumed their security expectations would be met and that this change was worth the economic disadvantages of giving up the association with the eu. indeed, when a few months later russia occupied crimea and annexed it after the fig leaf of a controlled referendum, armenians saw this as a model and justification for future annexation of nagornyy karabakh and the surrounding territories. russia’s actions had called into question all territorial dispositions after the soviet collapse, which had been agreed among the union republics, codified in the cis treaty, and endorsed by the international community. with borders now questioned and russia more capable of projecting power, it was better to be a close ally of russia than a potential victim.', 'but in april 2016, armenians suffered a rude awakening. on april 1, azerbaijan began a military operation along the line of contact in karabakh and, over the next four days, managed to regain a few strategic points occupied by the karabakh armenians years before. russia’s reaction was to maintain its balancing act. russian foreign minister sergey lavrov went to the region explicitly to be a neutral mediator. he brought a ceasefire plan and proposed the russian peacekeeping force that had been rejected so many years earlier. that approach did not go over well with the armenian populace. in their view, armenia was a treaty ally of russia and had given up european aspirations to stay in russia’s camp—and, therefore, russia should be on armenia’s side. however, as far as russia was concerned, legally, the combat had nothing to do with armenia but was between nagornyy karabakh and azerbaijan. the armenian people did not see it that way, after being convinced by their leaders over a generation that karabakh and armenia had become a single polity. sargsyan, who initially supported the idea of a russian peacekeeping force, was seen as having sold out armenian interests. he then had to backtrack, putting fatal cracks in his prestige and authority.', 'almost immediately, mutinies and demonstrations broke out, occasionally with a subtle anti-russian flavor. in july 2016, a group of gunmen calling themselves sasna tsrer (“daredevils of sassoun,” from an armenian epic poem) violently took over a police station and held out against government forces for two weeks, demanding sargsyan’s resignation. even after they surrendered, they retained widespread support, which translated into a people fed up with the ruling elite and with russia.', ' other factors—such as a notorious murder by a russian soldier, price hikes by the russian-owned electricity supplier, and continued arms sales to azerbaijan—further exacerbated popular discontent.', 'in 2017, faced with term limits when his presidency was to expire in 2018, sargsyan chose one of the standard post-soviet autocratic solutions to staying in power: establishing a parliamentary system, turning the presidency into a figurehead, and becoming prime minister. sargsyan and his dashnak nationalist allies duly won parliamentary elections in 2017, and a figurehead president was in due course elected in 2018. then the play went off script: the aggrieved populace rose up in demonstrations, and in just over a month, sargsyan was ousted. opposition leader nikol pashinyan was installed as acting prime minister, and new elections affirmed his position later in the year.', 'so far, this scenario resembles one of the “color revolutions” that putin had railed against for the previous fifteen years and had tried to reverse through military force in georgia, syria, and ukraine. but instead of condemning pashinyan (who had sharply criticized russia during the demonstrations) and lending full support to sargsyan (one of putin’s most loyal supporters), putin was remarkably restrained throughout and had a friendly and supportive meeting with pashinyan just days after the latter took power, publicly offering him his congratulations and best wishes.', 'it is possible that russia blamed sargsyan for the anti-russian sentiment following the clashes of april 2016.', ' but it is also clear that pashinyan made efforts to reassure putin, as he—like the entire armenian electorate—understood that russia remained the guarantor of armenia’s security vis-à-vis its much larger neighbors. he also understood that any rift with russia would create a vulnerability that azerbaijan could exploit with regard to karabakh; pashinyan knew he could not afford any daylight between armenia and russia. he left armenia in the eaeu and csto. he made clear that he would pursue a democratic system, but he “also said that he viewed democracy as a firm belief, rather than a geopolitical orientation, making clear the distinction.”', ' perhaps the fact that putin knew this as well, implying no major changes in armenia’s strategic orientation, occasioned his restraint: if there is no threat that armenia will leave its camp, russia can continue balancing its policy toward azerbaijan and armenia.', 'azerbaijan is the type of country with which putin seems to feel comfortable—a stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policies. azerbaijan causes few headaches for russia and demands only that its transactional approach be reciprocated. president ilham aliyev began his rule only three years after putin took over russia; his father heydar aliyev had ruled azerbaijan for a decade before that, not counting the soviet period, when he also ruled the country as his own fiefdom. heydar aliyev’s time in the senior-most ranks of the soviet state, communist party, and security services ', ' made his attitude very different from other post-soviet rulers, some of whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki in soviet times and saw moscow as the source of all power. heydar aliyev treated russia’s post-soviet rulers without the fealty or fear that some of his contemporaries showed.', 'ilham aliyev does not have the experience or ability of his father, but he has inherited that legacy of autonomous sovereignty. if pashinyan intends to show that democracy is a belief, not a geopolitical choice, the aliyevs have long since shown that the same is true of autocracy. azerbaijan and russia have enjoyed a functional, transactional relationship that is cordial, neighborly, and devoid of emotion. to some extent, azerbaijan grew ideologically closer to russia in the wake of the ukraine crisis, as both countries saw themselves as attacked and undermined by a fifth column of western-supported civil society and nongovernmental organizations. in 2014, the chief of azerbaijan’s presidential apparatus—usually considered closest to russia in the azerbaijani leadership—published a long, scathing article outlining that worldview. he even implied that charges of human rights violations against a country only proved that its leadership was defending its sovereignty.', 'but ideological sympathy never overcame azerbaijan’s transactional approach to relations with russia. in 2012, azerbaijan demanded a sharp increase in the rent russia was paying for the soviet-era qabala radar station. the station was part of the soviet and russian strategic early warning system, and therefore the united states favored its continued functioning to help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launches. nonetheless, azerbaijan stuck to its price demands, and the russians eventually closed the station at the end of 2012.', 'apart from its transactional approach, the azerbaijani leadership has a single prism for judging the actions of all other countries: the karabakh conflict. since independence, azerbaijan has rejected virtually all forms of multilateral cooperation involving armenia. that has imposed a durable limit on the extent of rapprochement with russia. for example, azerbaijan has not joined the csto, of which armenia is a member; to do so, it would have to renounce any military solution to the karabakh conflict, and it has been a tenet of faith in azerbaijan that only the credible threat of a military solution can pressure armenia to negotiate seriously. nor has azerbaijan joined the eaeu, as armenia did. joining it could limit azerbaijan’s ability to use its economic leverage to marshal international support on karabakh and counter armenian diaspora influence in the west, particularly in the united states and france.', 'indeed, because russia’s annexation of crimea calls into question the borders of the former soviet republics—which the republics recognize as state borders under the alma-ata declaration of december 21, 1991—it also calls into question the basis for azerbaijani claims to sovereignty over nagornyy karabakh. moreover, for the last fifteen years, proposed principles for a negotiated peace in the karabakh conflict have included a “binding expression of the popular will” as part of the ultimate disposition of the territory.', ' the russia-staged referendum in crimea drove home to the azerbaijanis how easy it is for the power with boots on the ground to ensure its desired outcome in such a vote.', 'all in all, since 2014, azerbaijan has become, if anything, even more transactional in its approach to russia. the 2016 offensive in karabakh, which might earlier have been deterred by reluctance to antagonize russia, can be seen as one example. the fighting azerbaijan initiated on september 27, 2020, can also be seen as a transaction with russia—one made possible by turkish intervention. to be sure, one aim of the offensive is to regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chips from armenia’s side of the board. but perhaps the larger aim is to threaten putin with instability and possibly a region-wide war if he does not force deep concessions on armenia. aliyev ignored lavrov’s initial offer: the return of two provinces, in exchange for russia being allowed to deploy a peacekeeping force.', ' whatever the outcome, it is clear that to azerbaijan, russia is now less of a partner and more of a problem to be solved.', 'azerbaijan tries to solve its russia problem through closer relations with, in particular, turkey and china. turkey has long been azerbaijan’s main advocate in the international sphere. aside from ethnic kinship (a significant azeri population lives in eastern turkey) and deep historical links before the soviet takeover, turkey is quick to cite certain protectorate rights granted under the treaties of moscow and kars (1921). since independence, azerbaijan has seen turkey as a counterweight to russian power. at present, however, turkey has its own complex relations with russia. turkey enjoys the positive effects of continued close energy and pipeline relations, as well as personal interactions between putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan; but offsetting these effects are sharp differences between turkey and russia on the conflicts in syria and libya. azerbaijan seeks to ensure that turkey’s support vis-à-vis russia is unwavering. turkey’s support of azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement in the autumn 2020 fighting have granted azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver vis-à-vis russia—both on the battlefield and with regard to russian mediation efforts. it took the kremlin almost two weeks to arrange a putin-aliyev phone call; a humanitarian truce brokered by lavrov fell apart almost immediately.', 'china has increased its engagement with the caucasus as part of its belt and road initiative, though neither its trade nor investment in the region compare with its far more massive engagement in central asia.', ' its main partner in the region is azerbaijan, which has the largest population, economy, and reserves of natural resources. the partnership makes sense geopolitically as well: although china is now a major trading partner for armenia and georgia, armenia is too dependent on russia to be pried loose and china is probably wary of russian sensitivities on georgia. china has now become the third largest source of imports for azerbaijan, after russia and turkey. azerbaijan presents the most potential for future political rapprochement, and china, unlike the west, is not burdened with concerns over azerbaijan’s human rights record. azerbaijan hopes that as the belt and road initiative progresses, china will increase its use of azerbaijan for the transit of cargo to europe—floating cargo across the caspian and loading it onto the railroad link opened in 2017 between baku and kars, in turkey, via georgia.', 'putin once famously declared that he would hang saakashvili by his testicles.', ' that promise remains unfulfilled, but not for want of trying. saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority in 2012 and was voted out of office in 2013. if putin thought saakashvili’s ouster by the billionaire (and, until shortly before then, russian citizen) bidzina ivanishvili and his georgian dream party would liberate a wellspring of affection for russia, he was in for disappointment. the georgian populace remains deeply suspicious of russia. in late 2014, nato initiated a major assistance program, the substantial nato-georgia package, sharply ramping up security cooperation with the georgian dream government.', 'russia’s hostile and aggressive policy toward georgia, too, remains unchanged. as always, the pressure point between russia and georgia has been separatism, namely the russia-backed polities in abkhazia and south ossetia. in the run-up to putin’s return to the presidency, long-serving local officials in many areas controlled by russia, especially in the russia-supported south ossetia and abkhazia (and transdniestria, outside the region), were ousted, with moscow backing newcomers who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience to putin alone. at the end of 2011, edmund kokoity, who had ruled south ossetia since 2001, was forced to resign from the leadership and was ultimately replaced by leonid tibilov, a veteran of the kgb.', ' in abkhazia, the death of sergei bagapsh in may 2011 triggered a premature power struggle that threw the plans off track; in the elections that followed, moscow’s chosen candidate, raul khajimba, was defeated. however, with the intervention of putin’s fixer vladislav surkov, president alexander ankvab was ousted in june 2014 and khajimba was installed.', 'by then, russia had occupied and annexed crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprisings in donbass, as well as kharkiv and odessa; in response, the west had imposed sanctions. perhaps this left putin and his regime less concerned with placating western opinion, and he moved to annex the separatists in all but name. as early as october 13, 2014—the month after khajimba’s inauguration—russia presented abkhazia with a draft treaty of alliance, integration and partnership, whose main points were the takeover of key executive departments of the abkhaz “state” by their russian homologues, with, at best, nominal abkhazian security institutions serving as a fig leaf. russia presented south ossetia with a draft comprising identical terms at about the same time, though the first public announcement came in november. in the treaties that were eventually signed, the abkhaz won face-saving concessions from the russians;', ' it took four drafts before the south ossetians signed, but their version was closer to the russian original.', ' (the close informal relations between south ossetia and north ossetia made the words on paper less important.) the stifling embrace of moscow—and the suspected poisoning of khajimba’s electoral rival', '—led to the ouster of khajimba in early 2020 and his replacement by aslan bzhania, himself a veteran of the kgb.', ' in south ossetia, anatoliy bibilov, who had floated between the north and south ossetian militaries, defeated tibilov.', 'russian actions have continued to ensure that georgian resentment over the ', ' remains an open wound. the process of borderization continues in south ossetia: russian border troops periodically erect new border fences that enclose bits of land hitherto under georgian control. in july 2015, new border fences cut off part of the strategic baku-supsa oil pipeline, the line that carried azerbaijani “early oil” to market in the west before the main baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline was completed. russia has not interfered with the oil flow, but the implied threat is clear.', 'for its part, it appears that georgia under saakashvili tried to return this threat by reopening links with chechen and islamist rebel groups in the north caucasus, as shevardnadze had done with the chechen commander gelayev in 2001. russia charged in 2009—and again in 2012 after a murky incident in the lopota gorge (between the pankisi gorge and dagestan)—that georgia was arming and training chechen militants to fight inside russia. in 2017, several years after saakashvili was replaced by the less anti-russian georgian dream party, the chechen commander involved in the lopota incident was killed by georgian security forces in tbilisi.', 'thus, a cycle of perceived provocations followed by emotional reactions and retaliations continues today. most recently, a russian’s mere choice of seating at a meeting led to crisis between the two countries. from june 19 to 23, 2019, the interparliamentary assembly on orthodoxy met in the parliament in tbilisi with orthodox parliamentarians from many countries in attendance. this was presumably intended as a gesture at reconciliation between the orthodox majorities of russia and georgia. on june 20, a member of the russian state duma presided over the session and sat in the georgian parliament chair’s seat. violent street protests immediately broke out in tbilisi, disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation of georgia’s parliament chair the following day.', ' amid continuing protests against russia in tbilisi, putin ordered the cessation of direct flights between georgia and russia—as he had in the run-up to the 2008 war.', ' the incident highlights that symbols of power relations evoke both charged emotions and material retaliations and that the pattern of events will be repeated for the foreseeable future.', 'it is hard not to conclude that putin’s personal overreach in ukraine has led to suboptimal results for russia in the south caucasus. when he resumed the presidency of russia, putin increased engagement with the south caucasus, perhaps hoping to gather some castaway stones closer into the russian camp. by autumn, 2013, everything seemed to be going his way: armenia (and ukraine) had bowed to his demands to reject association agreements with the eu and to sign on instead with the eaeu that putin had singlehandedly created, promoted, and dominated. relations with azerbaijan were on an even keel without much expenditure of effort. and georgia’s despised saakashvili had been replaced by a russian billionaire whose government was floating trial balloons about normalizing relations with moscow despite russia’s recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia.', 'but relations with all three south caucasus countries reverted to type after russia’s intervention in ukraine. moscow’s stifling embrace of rulers such as sargsyan and khajimba led to popular discontent and their forcible ousters. the precedents set on ukrainian territory led azerbaijan to proceed with extreme caution in its relations with russia. and russia’s expansionist policies with regard to abkhazia and south ossetia have guaranteed the hostility of the georgian populace and repudiation by what might have been a friendlier government. as observers have noted, major outside powers such as china, turkey, and the eu have capitalized on local suspicions of russia. they have developed strong interests in all three south caucasus countries and have the wherewithal to defend those interests against russian maneuvering, while also providing the locals with greater room for maneuver. turkey’s willingness to take a major military role in support of azerbaijan in the fighting that began september 27 shows that russian power no longer has the deterrent effect it once did against intervention by outside powers. russian interests themselves are not yet seriously threatened, but expansion of those interests has been blunted. one can say, then, that russia’s policies in the south caucasus and in the wider post-soviet space have forced it back on the stony path it had been treading for a generation and will probably tread for some time to come.', 'philip remler is a nonresident scholar at the carnegie endowment for international peace. prior to joining carnegie, he

of conversation at fancy restaurants and in the corridors of power.', 'the prevailing view is that a victory for biden would be bad for russia, because a democratic administration is expected to impose new economic sanctions on moscow as punishment for its bad behavior—first and foremost, for its interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election. this view is widely shared by pro-kremlin pundits, senior officials and the executives of state-owned enterprises, and is even promoted by the few remaining independent russian media outlets such as the ', ' newsletter, a daily staple in the

of being a russian asset—and who knows how to organize a normal process for national security discussions—will be able to restore some guardrails to the u.s.-russia relationship and prevent further deterioration, those people argue. a president biden would not be able to pay close attention to russia, since he and his senior advisers will be overwhelmed by domestic issues and otherwise focusing on china. but a possible new democratic administration appears to be open to retaining some pillars of the arms control regime and discussing rules of competition in cyberspace. and it could be more clear-eyed—and therefore skeptical—about the side effects and efficiency of sanctions as the united states’ major tool in russia policy. much will depend on who is put in senior positions such as

russia believes that four more years of trump could be good for moscow. if trump is reelected, the only silver lining will be the even deeper level of disarray in the western alliance and u.s.

'at the very least, analysts expect that a victory for biden would increase tensions between washington and moscow, and would raise the probability of new sanctions on russia.', 'the country is already operating under international sanctions on some key sectors and russian officials close to putin, for actions including its annexation of crimea from ukraine in 2014, interference in the u.s. election in 2016 and reported involvement in a nerve agent attack in the u.k. in 2018.', 'andrius tursa, central and eastern europe advisor at teneo intelligence, said a win for biden would improve transatlantic ties between the u.s. and europe and would see \"a renewed u.s. commitment to nato\" that would be welcomed by europe.', 'however he also said such a result would mean \"mostly downsides for russia,\" citing a recent history of mutual distrust and acrimonious relations between the kremlin and u.s. democrats.', '\"in general, a potential biden presidency would be negative for moscow and likely lead to a further deterioration of bilateral relations, both in terms of rhetoric and substance. the democratic party\\'s candidate has long maintained a tough stance towards president

russia in response to the 2014 ukrainian crisis.\"', 'a meaningful conflict resolution over crimea, and in the donbass region in east ukraine (where there are two pro-russian regions that declared themselves republics) still eludes moscow and kiev, despite efforts by germany and france to broker a lasting settlement that both sides can live with.', 'tursa argued that without tangible process in

enforcement of existing measures.', 'the risk of new sanctions could also increase, he said, ', 'any new sanctions on russia are unlikely to be imposed immediately, however, according to timothy ash,

\"important for the u.s. to have a business-like relationship with russia to ensure delivery on the u.s.\\'s strategic interests.\"', 'he said the two sides, under a biden presidency, would have to \"learn where they can tolerate each other and get along on certain areas of mutual interest — such as arms control — and reducing risks of conflict where strategic interests compete, for example on areas like ukraine, even belarus and turkey. sanctions will be part of the tool kit herein, but only one such tool.\"', ' is an area that both russia-watchers believe could be a point of mutual interest and some harmony, however. biden has signaled as much, saying in 2019 that he would want to see an extension of the major u.s.-russian nuclear arms reduction treaty, known as the new strategic arms reduction treaty, or the implementation something similar.', '\"based on recent statements from both sides, negotiations on a new strategic arms reduction treaty (start) is one area

in russia—are quite similar to those it pursues with domestic firms. authorities want to maximize surveillance potential, disrupt any possibility of domestic political unrest as a result of those companies’ content or services, and continue projecting disinformation through the internet.', 'recent battles over data localization, or the mandated storage of certain kinds of data within russia’s borders, exemplify the kremlin’s desire to maximize its own surveillance potential through foreign companies. like many authoritarian governments that viewed the internet’s free information flows as a threat to regime security, moscow ', ' in 2014 that companies with data on russian citizens store it locally. firms could maintain copies of the data elsewhere, but the data itself had to sit in russian servers, well within the broad legal and political jurisdiction of the russian security services described above. in recent years, u.s. companies like facebook and twitter have seemingly just ', ' these orders and continued paying the trivial, court-ordered ', ', but pressures are likely to grow as putin further ', '.', 'russia’s moves to cement state control over data storage fit into a broader picture of government efforts to centralize internet data flows, designed at the internet’s inception to prioritize fast and reliable delivery above all else, to enable more effective government management and surveillance. though the process is often purely technical, the objectives are fundamentally political. in practice, these measures allow the russian government to surveil dissidents, ensure the privacy of russian citizen data against perceived malicious foreign access, and extend state information control in the digital domain.', 'simultaneously justifying two of the kremlin’s other main goals in this sphere—disrupting the potential for political pluralism enabled by foreign tech platforms and projecting the state’s own disinformation through those same vectors—requires a kind of argumentative gymnastics. the russian government has for years required foreign internet companies operating in russia to remove content it deems “false.”', 'should companies not comply, the kremlin has vested powers in roskomnadzor to initiate technical blocks on those websites. although these blocks are often evaded or poorly implemented, the government has still managed to pressure foreign companies to ', ' related to the covid-19 crisis. this minimizes the presence of state-critical or -contradictory information online in russia. at the same time, russian government propaganda outlets often have a large presence in major western platforms like twitter and youtube, and officials ', ' anytime those firms take action against russian state-controlled news outlets.', 'these inherent contradictions in the russian government’s approach to international tech companies—the kremlin wants these companies to operate in russia but only on the kremlin’s own terms; it pressures companies to suppress free speech inside russia but howls when russian government messaging abroad is met with wariness—mean that there is still space for international companies to effect a certain extent of internet freedom for russian citizens. this operating space, however, is under constant threat from the russian government and is likely to be the site of several major conflicts in coming years.', 'first, international firms may continue to push back against certain elements of russian state internet control. u.s. firms that have mostly resisted complying with data localization rules have not indicated any changed willingness to follow kremlin pressure. though, resistance of this kind won’t apply to every area online; it’s important to not group different components of internet control here. content takedowns, for example, are one domain of internet control in the covid-19 pandemic where the russian government was quite successful in getting even u.s. social media companies to ', ' from their platforms, within russia, that officials deemed “false.”', 'second, the struggle to maintain a “free internet” in russia will increasingly be defined by technical dimensions. the russian government in june decided to ', ' on telegram, the encrypted messaging app, essentially ', ' it lacked the technical capacity to block it. (ironically, this comprises a certain kind of payback for none other than pavel durov—telegram’s creator—who since losing vk and fleeing russia has built his messaging app into one of the world’s most popular.)', ' the sovereign internet law that came into force in 2019 ', ' for developing pernicious new technical censorship capabilities, including—perhaps most ominously—the ability to selectively censor content on international social media platforms in russia while maintaining plausible deniability. it also required domestic internet companies to centralize their architecture so authorities could potentially cut off the russian internet from the rest of the world in the event of a security incident, broadly defined. thus, it will be incumbent on supporters of internet freedom to continue developing anti-censorship technology and maintain the kind of technical edge that has allowed telegram to continue operating in russia without compromising on surveillance or censorship. (full disclosure: one of the authors of this article works for a company that develops anti-censorship software.)', 'and with moscow advancing internet control domestically, officials will continue seeking the normalization of this practice on the global stage. recently, these efforts have focused on the united nations, where ', ' the russian state has proposed alternative cybercrime treaties that seek to justify its repressive internet policies and practices, clashing with free and open internet norms upheld by democracies worldwide. in december 2019, for the first time, one of these proposals ', ', an indicator of broader support among governments for tighter internet control. this was not an accidental occurrence. instead, it spotlights ', ' to spread their authoritarian worldview and undermine a global free and open internet model amid much democratic uncertainty on the future of the internet.', 'these outcomes should also serve as a reminder to tech companies, policymakers, and anyone who cares about maintaining an open global internet that internet freedom is neither inevitable nor permanent. russia’s domestic internet sector, once a model of pluralism and independent thought, has been thoroughly subverted to the ends of the government. as a once global internet splinters into ', ', it will take a concerted opposition effort to maintain international

are already installed.', 'the united aircraft corporation, which now has manufacturing responsibility for the blackjack, announced that the “deeply modernized” tu-160m had performed its first flight with its new serial-production nk-32-02 engines at the kazan aircraft production association airfield in southwest russia on november 3, 2020. the flight lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes and saw the

“was equipped with new flight and navigation equipment, an onboard communications system, modernized control system, radar, and ', '.”', 'lack of engines had been a serious hurdle in moscow’s ambitious plans to restart production of the blackjack, which had originally come to a halt in 1994 after just 36 examples - three of them non-flying static test airframes - had been completed. with the collapse of the soviet union, 10 of the tu-160s left in ukrainian territory were scrapped. another four of the bombers were left unfinished on the assembly line and two of these were eventually

southwestern city of samara received a contract to restart production of the blackjack’s nk-32 turbofans, now producing an improved nk-32-02 version. the first of these engines was planned to be ready for tests in 2016 and some observers have expected that the same powerplant to be used in russia’s still-secretive and still-unseen pak da new-generation bomber. as well as powering new-build

over 55,000 pounds of thrust at full afterburner.\\xa0', 'while the nk-32-02 is considered a “new” engine, it actually dates back to the mid-1980s, when the soviet union canceled its production on cost grounds. the improvements over the initial design included new blades for the compressor and turbine, plus more efficient cooling.', 'the nk-32-02 is understood to have the same output as the original powerplant but offers increased efficiency, extending the bomber’s range by around 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, according to russian media reports. tupolev has in the past claimed a 13 percent overall range increase. \\xa0', 'the program to get the blackjack back into production has been a protracted one, perhaps not altogether surprisingly, as the effort to reinstate a production line and setup required tooling after decades of inactivity is considerable. in january 2018, the russian ministry of defense signed a contract for the next 10 new-build blackjacks, which cost around $270 million per copy. plans called for a first example for the russian aerospace forces to be rolled out in 2021; according to ', ', this schedule is still on track.', 'in the past, the

parallel with the new-production blackjacks, russia has been busy with a mid-life upgrade program for its existing tu-160s, including new mission systems and avionics. originally, the existing bombers were to be designated tu-160m after completing their upgrade, while the new-build aircraft would be designated tu-160m2. this has now been rationalized, and both variants are now known as tu-160ms.', 'therefore, the first aircraft to be re-engined with the new nk-32-02 turbofans is not a new-build blackjack, but either an example from the earlier production batch that has been brought up to tu-160m status or a prototype for the new-build aircraft constructed using one of the two incomplete airframes from the original production run.', 'one of these two unfinished aircraft has been completed as a tu-160m, perhaps to serve as a proof-of-concept for the new-build bombers. this aircraft was ', ' and began flight trials in january 2018. it is named ', ' after the former russian air

ukraine in 1999, after the fleet had been left there following the dissolution of the soviet union.', \"the full tu-160m configuration includes a new novella radar as well as a new self-defense suite and electronic surveillance system. the flight deck is now equipped with a 'glass cockpit' and the revised avionics encompass the communication suite, flight control system, and navigation suite.\", 'alongside the “deeply modernized” tu-160m, russia has also been performing a less-extensive upgrade on its blackjack fleet, at a rate of one or two aircraft per year. this is the so-called “small modernization,” or tu-160m1, and provides a digital upgrade for the aircraft’s inertial navigation and engine control systems, as well as armament.', 'russia’s deputy prime minister yuri borisov has said the russian aerospace forces will continue to operate modernized tu-160ms (both upgraded and new-build examples) “until the 2050s or even the 2060s.”\\xa0', 'considering the blackjack can now

the other hand, the continued focus on the blackjack — including the tricky task of bringing it back into production — should be seen against the prospects for the future pak da, which stands for perspektivnyi aviatsionnyi kompleks dalney aviatsii, or future air complex of long-range aviation.\\xa0', 'the research and development program for the pak da began around 2009, ', ' the order to resume tu-160 production. that suggests that difficulties faced by the pak da program led to the new bomber program’s priority being reduced in favor of the tried and tested blackjack.', 'to this day, there has been no official concept art of the pak da, so we really have no idea what the design looks like. however, most observers expect that it will be a subsonic “flying wing” design, possibly with low-observable (stealthy) features.', 'tupolev’s concept for the pak da was apparently approved in 2013, after which the united aircraft corporation received a follow-on contract for detailed design work and other contracts to develop the aircraft’s systems. the then commander of russia’s long-range aviation branch, anatoly zhikharev, said in late 2014 that a pak da prototype would fly in 2019.', 'in 2015, however, the idea of resuming series production of the tu-160 appeared and with this, the urgency assigned to the pak da seems to have diminished. indeed, speaking in 2018, deputy prime minister borisov described that relaunching production of the blackjack was “a less risky path” than the pak da. “at the same time, we have postponed the pak da, to gain experience and restore technology”, he added. borisov’s predecessor, dmitry rogozin, had the same year said that the pak da would perform its first flight in 2023 or 2024.', 'the prospects of the pak da taking to the air in that kind of timeframe seem remote, especially as the focus is now on the tu-160’s continued upgrade and production restart, which will consume both funding and production capacity at the kazan plant. meanwhile, similar upgrade programs for the ', ' and ', ' strategic bombers further reduce the urgency of getting the pak da into service.\\xa0', 'there is also the enormous cost involved in getting a sophisticated “clean-sheet” design into production and service in meaningful numbers. moscow’s planned purchases of ', ' new-generation fighters currently stand at just 76 and other expensive weapons

azerbaijan emboldened by turkish support – might suggest that russia is facing a rival power in its neighbourhood. but for many in moscow the advantage of having the west out still outweighs the nuisance of having turkey in. moscow knows ankara and has learned to work with it. the two capitals are far from being allies: their goals in the middle east often stand in direct opposition to each other. but both realise they need each other, as they cannot achieve their aims without some acquiescence from the other. and most importantly, the turkish government is motivated by goals that in the kremlin’s eyes are rational: strengthening its power at home, enhancing its leverage abroad, and pursuing economic and security interests. it lacks any western-style rule-centric approach and instead subscribes to a worldview that moscow understands.', 'azerbaijan, too, has pursued its foreign policy without challenging russia’s philosophical standpoint or historical narratives even though at times it has been at odds with moscow. this is why russia might be more relaxed than expected, even though its armenian ally is in trouble: “russia may have reasons to help its ally armenia, but it has no reason at all to punish azerbaijan, which has been an example of model behavior among the former soviet states, as far as russia is concerned”, ', ' carnegie scholar alexander baunov. in

made great efforts in august to signal to moscow their restraint and desire not to ‘geopoliticise’ the conflict – in the hope that moscow would mirror the position, thus allowing for an ‘armenian-style’ political transition with no geopolitical contest around it.', 'all to no avail. after adopting a wait-and-see position for around two weeks after the election, moscow made up its mind and embarked on a strategy of transition – one that saves some face for lukashenka; deepens russia’s leverage in the country; brings to power a leader acceptable to moscow; keeps both the west and the osce at arm’s length; and, most importantly, demonstrates that popular revolution is not an effective way to transfer power. one can imagine scenarios under which moscow could reconsider its approach, change strategy, and even reach out to the lithuania-based opposition. but all these would stem from developments inside belarus itself – such as strikes that paralyse the country, or the regime splitting and crumbling – rather than something the west does or says.\\xa0', 'the lesson for the west is clear enough: to influence post-soviet – or any – crises, one needs to have true

country’s longest running protest. for more than a hundred consecutive days, thousands have taken to the streets waving flags, holding pickets and staging marches.', 'the protests were sparked in july by the arrest of the region’s former governor, sergei furgal. a charismatic businessman and local politician, furgal scored a surprise electoral victory over his predecessor vyacheslav shport, the kremlin’s preferred candidate, in 2018. in dramatic scenes earlier this year, he was pulled out of his car and arrested by federal officers, who had been flown in directly from moscow. he stands

initially demanded furgal’s release from the moscow jail where he is being held and for his case to be tried locally, their chants are now more often broad criticisms of both president vladimir putin

tended more toward ultranationalism than liberalism, calling for russian expansion into ukraine and belarus. in 2013, the party’s representatives in the state duma proposed a bill banning the use of

are sent to the region from moscow… but furgal was different. he helped us.” his arrest – and the appointment of mikhail degtyarev, a moscow politician, as his interim replacement – created a narrative that the kremlin was interfering in local affairs from afar.', 'russia’s expansive east, beginning at the urals and stretching through siberia to the sea of japan, has long had an uneasy balance with its western center. since the days of imperial russia, its towns and cities have been seen as a mere extension of the european nation – an asian frontier to be settled and tamed. as part of the soviet union, mass deportations eastwards and its status as a destination for gulag prisoners reinforced that notion. but now, as the protesters in khabarovsk show, russia’s far east might be forming its own identity.', 'one major point of contention is that while eastern russia holds much of the country’s natural resources – including oil, gas, and rare earth metals – the proceeds from their extraction are widely seen to line pockets in the west, rather than enriching local communities. a series of environmental catastrophes in the far east, such as a petrochemical spill that led to

minority ethnic groups, and the far east is home to more than 25 distinct cultures. unlike the rest of the country, protestant congregations far outnumber those belonging to the moscow-based orthodox church. in the 19th century, ukrainians were encouraged to settle along the southeastern limits of the far east, from the border with china to the sea of okhotsk. the scheme was so successful that,

places like khabarovsk to the kremlin. his hand-picked governors, like the candidate that furgal defeated in 2018, have been the linchpins of that plan.', 'historically, moscow has used the precarious geography of the far east against those who sought to distance themselves from its power. with china’s eastern borders beginning just across the river from khabarovsk, the threat of expansionism and the need for protection was a compelling argument against going it alone. but now china’s presence in the far east is being felt in an altogether different way. beijing is behind billions of dollars

navalny gaining seats in the central asian cities of tomsk and novosibirsk. while navalny’s blend of ethnic nationalism might have made him an unlikely figure for young russians to unite around, his prominence as a critic of the kremlin made his bloc the de facto choice for a protest vote.', 'while some in russia’s far east do occasionally speak of an independent “united states of siberia,” the idea lacks prominent supporters or any realistic prospect of success. however, the tensions behind it and the growing resistance to being directly governed from another continent will continue to define relations between russia’s center and its extremities. for those in russia’s far east, moscow might seem like a world away – with eight time zones and a five-day train journey dividing them.

'on', 'by', 'on october 3, 2000, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and president vladimir putin cemented india-russia bilateral ties with the signing of the historical agreement, the “', '.” two decades since the signing of the agreement, bilateral relations are hailed to have chartered new levels of cooperation amid fast changing regional and global scenarios. while shouldering mutual interests and concerns, the strategic partnership has been at the cusp of litmus test, as it has endured events such as the 9/11 terrorist attack, colour revolutions, the georgian war, the economic depression in 2008, the 26/11 mumbai attack, the crimean referendum and its aftermath and the current covid-19 pandemic. it is therefore worth reflecting on the two decades of a seemingly positive bilateral engagement between india and russia. it is important to analyse how the agreement signed in 2000 has played a role in the continuum of ensuring the mutual understanding, peaceful cooperation and reliability between the two strategic partners. this is also an opportunity to critically evaluate the magnitude of our strategic relationship and the changes in the foreign policy priorities since 2000. given the current global context, the key question is how prepared are india and russia for insulating the strategic partnership amid the challenges in the post pandemic world?', 'the declaration of strategic partnership (2000) was signed at a time when the momentum in the bilateral relations between india and russia post-soviet collapse had fatigued due to several factors. but the most crucial factor of them all was the renewal of the ', '. the renewed 1993 treaty had almost written off the bilateral engagement, as russia clarified that it was no longer willing to make any defence commitment during the time of any external military threat to india – a key security clause (article ix) that constituted the very core of the 1971 indo-soviet treaty.', 'the strategic partnership treaty signed in 2000 gave a new lease of life as it restored india-russia relations to respectable levels.both the countries realised the need to develop a multifaceted bilateral cooperation in all possible spheres of defence, energy, space, nuclear, science and technology etc. india’s strategic partnership with russia since then has been unique, intense and substantive in many ways. mainly, the treaty led to the institutionalization of high level political interactions through annual bilateral summits – a key feature of the agreement to foster extensive collaboration and dynamism in the partnership. the twenty annual bilateral summits held so far between india and russia have in particular seen major agreements and initiatives undertaken to strengthen the partnership to higher levels.', 'additionally, in 2010, the bilateral ties were further elevated with the signing of the “', '.” arguably, the partnership between the two countries has been successfully reflected in many instances at regional and global platforms. ', ' general assembly referendum against russia for its accession of crimea in 2014 and russia’s unequivocal support to india on the kashmir issue are few cases in point.', 'regarding strategic partnership in sensitive spheres of cooperation between india and russia, defence cooperation continues to be one of the major boosters for engagement between the two countries. india has acknowledged russia’s contribution in assisting the former in military power projection and preserving its national security interests. although in recent times there is downgrading in the purchase of russian defence equipment by india, the cooperation in this sphere has been unassailable given that it has progressed from buyer-seller relations to joint research development and production, high-end technology transfer that has encouraged india’s quest for indigenous defence capabilities. from the induction of ins vikramaditya to the joint production of brahmos missile, india-russia defence cooperation has achieved new capacities through acquisitions and joint development. in fact, russia’s resurgence as a military power in recent times is conducive to india’s domestic initiatives such as the make in india project. the finalising of the ', ' despite the threat of imposition of caatsa sanctions has shown india’s predictable resistance to external pressures given its historical ties with russia.', 'indo-russian nuclear cooperation constitutes an important element of our strategic partnership. the kudankulam nuclear power plant (knpp) has become one of the biggest success stories of india-russia cooperation. as unit 1 and unit 2 start commercial operation, the process for reactor buildings of units 3 and 4 have already begun. with the construction of 12 nuclear power plants planned, india-russia nuclear cooperation has indeed reached new heights. india, russia and bangladesh signed a trilateral agreement in march 2018, for the construction of a npp in rooppur, bangladesh.', ' has been another major element of the strategic partnership, since russia, an export-oriented energy country, will aim to leverage its energy card with india, an import-oriented energy market. india’s interests in the arctic, for instance, especially energy resources, are a crucial aspect for india’s growing energy security needs. ', '. this is seen as a great step towards strengthening india-russia energy cooperation.', 'the bilateral partnership, which has a global strategic connotation, has seen both the countries enthusiastically promote the idea of building a multipolar world order and changing the global financial structure. in this regard, both india and russia have envisaged promoting a harmonious global order based on international law and collective decision-making that includes developing countries and is not monopolised by developed countries alone. india and russia, along with other players such as china, have succeeded in establishing non-western organisations such as brics and sco. the member states have, within their capabilities and limitations, established mechanisms that address economic and strategic interests, such as the new development bank. while brics and sco have become tools of political signalling on issues related to global affairs, there however exist asymmetries among the member states with regard to economic growth performance, distribution of resources and military strength. additionally, although china is a member of such multilateral organisations, at the individual level beijing has exercised assertive posturing that has caused concern in india. this can be seen by its irrational border claims and actions in the indian ocean region. the role of russia especially during the time of crisis between india and china is therefore anticipated to be non-partisan and meaningful.', 'when the treaty of strategic partnership was signed in 2000, the world was at the brink of a war on terrorism after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade centre. both india and russia, at their respective level, joined the bandwagon on the global war on terror. both parties, as bilateral partners which have been victims of terrorist attacks, voiced their interests and concerns in combating terrorism and related activities. india and russia have therefore cooperated at bilateral and multilateral levels. for instance, ', '. india and russia also share the mutual interest of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their possible acquisition by terrorist groups.', 'while both india and russia assert their distinctive identity in world politics respectively, the strategic partnership has seen close coordination of foreign policy interests to a wide range of international and regional issues. both countries firmly believe that intensification of the indo-russian strategic partnership can help respond to the challenges thrown up by global changes in a more effective way. while both india and russia have a diverging approach on the indo-pacific narrative, one cannot deny that the two countries understand the need for ', ' in accordance with the universally accepted principles of international law. this includes combating piracy at sea and providing humanitarian aid during natural disasters. the two countries have shown keen interest in restoring peace and stability in afghanistan. eurasian integration has been a key priority in the india-russia strategic partnership. russia understands that in its quest for “greater eurasia,” india is a vital player for its huge market potential, economic growth performance, military strength and enhanced position in international affairs.', 'strategic partnership in ', ' between india and russia since the soviet era and has continued to remain one even today. in fact, both countries have agreed to expand their relations in the aerospace sphere, an area of traditional cooperation for decades. more than 500 joint projects involving scientists and research institutes from both countries have been undertaken within the framework of various initiatives since 2000.', 'while critically evaluating the two decades of strategic partnership between india and russia, it is tempting to compare india’s strategic partnership with other major global players and the strategic partnership that it shares with russia. the new realities of the dynamic nature of international relations have definitely posed a challenge to the partnership. the pursuing of an all-alignment foreign policy has caused a certain level of discomfort in the bilateral relations. india’s growing proximity with the u.s. and russia’s compromised defence cooperation with china and mending of ties with pakistan in recent times has caused anxiety in the strategic partnership between india and russia. one possible inference that one can draw is the constant comparison to the current india-russia partnership with that of the nostalgia of indo-soviet ties. but one needs to bear in mind that compared to the strategic partnership that both india and russia share with other major players, there are limitations and shrouded with lack of trust. india’s defence relations with u.s., for instance, is yet to make any substantive development in joint production and restrictiveness about its technology compared to russia’s generosity to sharing defence technology and russia’s relations with pakistan is eclipsed with lack of trust and understanding. as for russia-china relations, there is growing speculation of a possible role reversal in the partnership given china’s growth in global politics in recent times.', 'however, there are few stumbling blocks in india-russia defence cooperation, especially the shifting trends in partnership, for example defence engagement between russia and china. russia’s current cooperation with china has emerged exclusively, as it includes cooperation in sensitive fields, such as strategic missile defence, hypersonic technology, and the construction of nuclear submarines. with ', ', allowing for the latter to be well equipped with similar and more advanced capabilities, china is a major security concern for india. hence, given the way ', ', collaboration in advanced future weapon systems, including quantum technology and artificial intelligence, should be enhanced further between india and russia.', 'indo-russian relations are undoubtedly at the cusp of a litmus test. nonetheless, the strategic partnership should see the future of asia beyond the u.s. and china factors, and both india and russia can play a decisive role in promoting their mutual interests in the region.', 'the rapid and uncontrollable spread of covid-19 in the past seven months has impacted the global order and the interconnected systems. reflecting the spirit of the partnership in times of crisis, ', '. russia also welcomed india’s goodwill gesture to send medical supplies to help fight the virus.', 'critics have often pointed out that the strategic partnership is yet to achieve its full potential, given the fact that some of the spheres of cooperation continue to be remain obsolete, for instance, the economic relations. additionally, given nearly 70 years of diplomatic relations, soft power capabilities, cultural diplomacy, academic exchange programmes, and labour migration are at an imperceptible status.', 'trade and investment remains the weakest link in our strategic partnership and falls far short of our potential, which unfortunately is not commensurate with our high-level political cooperation. post the announcement of the strategic agreement in 2000, which largely promotes the strengthening of economic relations between india and russia, the trade cart received much required upgrade. potential areas of trade have been explored, which include trade and investment, energy, nuclear, science and technology, pharmaceuticals, it, steel, diamonds, fertilizers, infrastructure, heavy engineering and food products. exploring economic prosperity, sustainable development, and free movement of people, information, knowledge, ideas and greater institutional links has also become crucial.', 'in fact, both countries have set a target of ', ' in each other’s country by the year 2025. it is also heartening that new options are being explored to further expand the domain of economic cooperation, eurasian integrity, regional cooperation, free trade agreements, connectivity and trade corridors have gained the utmost importance in the annual bilateral summits in the past two decades. the two countries have also set up mechanisms such as intergovernmental commissions. for example, ', ' (irigc-tec), the international north south transport corridor and the eurasian economic union, which have emerged as immediate priority areas for strong economic cooperation between the two countries.', 'the russian far-east is another region for potential economic engagement. india’s presence in the eastern economic forum (eef) is aimed at developing trade, commerce, investment, railway infrastructure, steel plants, defence, space, ports and shipping. india has successfully participated in the annual eef, with prime minister ', ' for the development of the far east. other than these developments, our economic ties are focused on exploring the potential of sub-regional cooperation. sub-regional cooperation has emerged as one of the prospective areas of cooperation and regional connectivity to add further impetus to the economic cooperation between india and russia. the key goal is to cement and institutionalise cooperation between the states and union territories of the republic of india and provinces of the russian federation.', 'to further bolster india’s far ambitions, an ', ' of four indian states led by the commerce and industry minister of india piyush goyal visited vladivostok to explore the opportunities and potential of business to business (b2b) cooperation in the far. with the introduction of the ', ' in the world, the need for both india and russia to tap the potentials of agricultural sector is crucial. regional connectivity needs due attention, hence the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors, such as chennai-vladivostok, needs prompt engagement.', 'the major impact of the pandemic has prompted countries to explore alternate market destinations and shifts in the business environment. the crisis has opened opportunities for countries such as india and russia to reposition themselves in the global supply chain. russia, with its efforts to attract investment to the far east, and india, with its huge manpower and existing available manufacturing units, should be endorsed as potential and suitable alternatives for manufacturing, instead of developed nations.', 'despite the seemingly successful bilateral relations between india and russia, the strategic community is incomplete if there is shortfall in establishing strong people-to-people engagement. since the soviet collapse, bilateral relations have seen minimal cultural diplomacy, academic exchange and labour migration. perhaps new vistas of cooperation could be explored to promote soft power capabilities between the two countries, such as cinema, which has always been one of the most successful foreign policy tools to enhance cultural exchange and people-to-people contact between countries.', 'the film industry is a great medium for spreading narratives, and in india movies have an immense following as well as impact on the minds of the population. india and russia collaborated in movie production during the soviet era, however, the trend did not last long due to the fall of the soviet union, among other factors. the time is right for both india and russia to collaborate in the entertainment industry, especially through joint production of movies and creating powerful narratives related to bilateral cooperation. india and russia must concentrate more on the content of the movie rather than joint production alone, as for the audience the content matters more than the producer. moreover, it can have an everlasting impact on the minds of the indian population if the content projects a russian character aiding/collaborating with an indian protagonist in a movie in bringing down an antagonist. also, the indian movie industry is always on the look for exotic locations in foreign lands. hence, in order to attract the indian movie industry, russia could look into easing travel and other shooting permissions within its jurisdictions. such an effort would not only bring closer industry ties, but also be able to showcase the russia and its rich culture to the indian population, thereby acting as a window of promotion for russian tourism.', 'regarding geopolitical realignment, today the global community is seeking pragmatic internationalism. the role of india and russia is crucial in their efforts to diffuse the multipolar world system. this is also relevant for regional alliances to actively engage politically and economically, which should help bilateral relations between the two countries elevate to a higher pedestal in post-pandemic world order.', 'the current global situation has given rise to some daunting challenges for the partnership once again. some of the ', ' are linked to the disruptions being caused to the international order by traditional and non-traditional threats such as climate change, ', ', secure communication challenges etc. nurturing hopes for stability and prosperity in eurasia in the post pandemic world, bilateral relations between india and russia and their proactive role in regional mechanisms such as sco, eurasian economic union (eaeu), and russia-india-china (ric) are viewed as an integral part of this construct. regional connectivity needs due attention including the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors.', 'in conclusion, the signing of the milestone agreement in 2000 was the outcome of developments that took place in bilateral relations between india and russia after the fall of the soviet union. the main aim of the agreement was to elevate the partnership to new level of cooperation and put speculations and uncertainties in the relationship to rest. over the past twenty years of relations, the partnership has seen many ups and downs. nonetheless, this has not allowed any major damage that could impact or lead to any serious conflict of interest between the two countries. having said that, the coveted relations built over the years cannot be taken for granted. in this regard, apart from political elites and bureaucrats playing a crucial role in enhancing the relations, academicians, artists, students, the research community, think tanks and educational institutions should contribute to forming the true essence of the partnership. the youth, in particular, need to draw inspiration from each other’s rich history and cultural relevance, carrying forward the vision for a long-term partnership. the engagement of both countries in the international ecosystem in the post pandemic world has become even more relevant, as it has given rise to new challenges and opportunities. the strategic partnership between india and russia nevertheless needs to insulate the mutual interests from challenges that emerge from within and from external factors. perhaps, the need for a reality check and serious introspection will be crucial as the challenges are only set to grow given the dynamism of international relations.', 'from our partner ',

with you.\\xa0\", 'michael morrell: let me start with a couple of points for our listeners. first, i want to congratulate you on your new book, ', \" i've read it. it's terrific. i think it's a must read for anyone interested in national security. and i actually see it as a reference book for understanding the key issues. and i see myself pulling it down off the shelf from time to time. when i'm thinking about something, i want to have to talk about something, when i'm writing something. i think it's a very important contribution to the literature on the threats and challenges we face as a nation. so thank you. thank you very much for writing it.\", 'gen. mcmaster: well, michael, thanks so much. i mean it, somebody with your background, experience and knowledge to to endorse it like that. that means a lot to me that you judge it to have been worthwhile. thank you.', \"michael morrell: second, having you with us to talk about your book is a perfect way for us to kick off what is for us,\\xa0 going to be a new series on the key national security issues facing the united states. the series, which we're going to work very hard to be nonpartisan, will run between the \", \" and the inauguration. and finally, i should mention to my listeners that this episode is going to run the day after the election, but that you and i are taping it the friday before the election. so you and i have no idea what's going to happen on election day. so people should just know that as they're as they're listening to our conversation. and i think that's actually a good thing for our conversation, because what i want to do at the end of the day is get your sense of what is going to face the president who is sworn in on january 20th, no matter who that person happens to be.\", \"michael morrell: h.r. before we get to the individual issues that i want to walk through with you, i'd love to ask you why you decided to write the book that you did. you obviously could have written a very different kind of book. and i'm sure that there were publishers who were encouraging you to do that. but you chose not to do that. you chose to write a very serious look at the threats and challenges that face us as a nation. why did you take the route that you did?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, michael, thank you. i served in the army for thirty four years. so as i transitioned to what is my only second career in my adult life, i made out probably quite predictably, a mission statement for myself. and that was in my second career to try to deepen our understanding of the most crucial challenges we face as a way to better inform the american people about foreign policy and national security issues, and with the hope that if we learn more about these challenges that we face, we can demand better. demand a better foreign policy from our elected leaders. but then also, i hope that the book and the work that i'm doing around the book will help bring americans back together. right. because i don't think any of these issues should be partisan in nature. what i'm hoping for is that a deeper understanding of these challenges we face. and i think what should be our common commitment to try to build a better future for generations to come will help bring our country back together, at least around foreign policy and national security issues.\", 'michael morrell: h.r., what are the main themes of the book? what do you want readers to walk away remembering?', \"gen. mcmaster: well, what are the themes that runs through the book is this idea of strategic narcissism. i think this is one of the reasons why our competence, our ability to compete, at least in the post-cold war period, has been significantly diminished. and by strategic narcissism, i mean, our tendency to define the world only in relation to us and then to assume that what we decide to do or decide not to do is decisive to achieving a favorable outcome. and of course, you know, michael, with your long experience with intelligence, this is flawed because it's self-referential and it doesn't acknowledge, you know, the degree to which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future. so the book is then an argument, an argument for cultivating with my friend and great historian zachary shore has termed strategic empathy. and this is an effort, an effort to understand better what drives and constrains the other. especially adversaries, rivals and enemies and what drives and constrains the other often times is ideology and emotion and aspirations. so the theme in the book that also is important is an effort to understand how the recent past produced the present as the first step in making a projection into the future. so the book is an argument for the understanding of history and appreciation for the complex causality of events and a focus on understanding these crucial challenges we're facing from the perspective from the perspective of others.\", \"michael morrell: you know, that's one of the that's one of the main jobs of the intelligence community. right? is to is to give our decision makers the point of view of the other guy. the guy sitting across the table from you, the guy sitting across the battlefield from you. but what's the other guy thinking? what are his constraints? what are his interests? and that's extraordinarily important. right?\", \"gen. mcmaster:\\xa0 of course, it's not a new idea. it goes back to sun tzu, but i think it's we started to neglect the importance of this, especially in the post-cold war period, a period that i describe as a period of over optimism. over optimism that led to complacency and a bit of hubris. and this over optimism was in large measure a set up, i think a set of for significant disappointments in the two thousands disappointments, of course, associated with the mass murder attacks of september 11th, 2001, but also the unanticipated length and difficulty of wars in afghanistan and in iraq and, of course, followed by a financial crisis. and so i think it was in the two thousands that this emotional impetus behind our foreign policy shifted from overoptimism to pessimism and from maybe a tendency to under appreciate the risks and costs of action, to a tendency to underappreciate the risks and costs of inaction. and i think that strategic narcissism is the cause, really, in both cases.\", 'michael morrell: you know, the other thing that strikes me when you talk about the importance of history is i always thought sitting in deputies meetings that it would have been incredibly valuable to actually take a few minutes and every deputies meetings or principals meetings to talk about the history of the issue, just to review how you got from point a to point b, and we never did that in multiple administrations in which i served, but i always thought that that would have been really valuable.', \"gen. mcmaster: \\xa0well, michael, you're absolutely right about that. i'll tell you, one of the one of the great gifts i had, i think before earlier my career was the opportunity to read things, study and write history. and the first book i wrote was \", ', which is a story about how and why vietnam became an american war.\\xa0', \"and one of the lessons i learned from the study of that history was that it was important to understand problems and challenges holistically before leaping into action. when i came in as national security adviser, i did my best to at least avoid making the same mistakes and we put in place a principle small group framing session. i know that's a mouthful, but as we developed these strategies for the most crucial challenges we were facing, we began with this framing session that was organized around a five page paper that included only really the description of the challenge. how we got to where we are, a bit of the history of it, and then an inventory of our vital interests that were at stake, view of that challenge through the lens of those vital interests and draft overarching goals and more specific objectives, followed by assumptions.\\xa0\", \"assumptions about the degree to which we and like-minded partners have agency or influence over this challenge. then an inventory of obstacles to progress and opportunities that we could exploit. and that's it. then we had a discussion about the nature of the challenge. first, the policy coordinating committee, which, you know, are the real workers who are going to work on this project. they're listening in. so they're getting, they're hearing at the cabinet level, a discussion about the nature of the problem and then a refinement of it. once that part of the meeting was done, then we shifted to a discussion of what are your ideas? how do we integrate the elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to overcome these obstacles and exploit these opportunities? then they got to hear the treasury secretary say what we have. we have economic and financial tools available. but those ought to be combined with diplomacy and maybe law enforcement efforts. and then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with. so i think that, i hope that's a process that will be sustained. i don't think my successor hung onto it. it will have to be resurrected at some point if it is deemed as useful by a future national security adviser.\", \"michael morrell: i'm michael morrell today, we have with us h.r. mcmaster, a senior fellow at both stanford university's hoover institution and its graduate school of business. a career u.s. army officer and national security adviser to president trump. ok, so what i'd love to do is go through the individual issues. and what i'd like to do is just throw one out, get you to frame it. what's the threat or challenge that we face? what's the history? how did we get here? what's our interest that's at stake? and how do you think we as a nation need to go about dealing with it? let's start with the big one. let's start with the big enchilada, china.\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think china is a great example of strategic narcissism at work, and especially this assumption that we clung to for too long, that china, having been welcomed into the international order, would play by the rules, would liberalize its economy, and as it prospered, it would liberalize its form of government. of course, that's not true. that's not true because we undervalue the degree to which emotions and ideology drive and constrain the chinese communist party. and what i would argue in battlegrounds is that the party is driven mainly by fear, fear of losing its exclusive grip on power and an associated ambition. the ambition to achieve national rejuvenation for china to take center stage in the world again after the tragedy, as they portrayed as the century of humiliation. it is that combination of fear and aspiration that is driving the party's effort to extend and tighten its exclusive grip on power internally.\", \"this is why there are over a million people in concentration camps in xinjiang and there's a campaign of cultural genocide ongoing.\\xa0\", \"this is why the party is extending their repressive arm to hong kong and perfecting their technologically enabled orwellian surveillance police state. this is what we're seeing and then what is even more troubling, i think, is the parties now effort to export its authoritarian mercantilist model.\\xa0\", \"through a number of strategies that aim to create servile relationships with countries and then ultimately through economic means, as well as the growth in the people's liberation army's capabilities to establish areas of privacy across the new pacific region that exclude the united states and then it challenged the united states in the free world globally. if china succeeds, i mean, our world will be less free, less prosperous and less safe. so the stakes are high and it's past time for us to recognize the need to compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form of aggression that the parties engaged in.\", 'michael morrell: what would an effective china strategy look like to you?', \"gen. mcmaster: well, i think the trump administration, if it gets credit for anything, should get credit for a fundamental shift in our policy toward china. one that was long overdue and one that i think is fundamentally sound and this is the idea that we have to compete. and it was under the strategy of of cooperation and engagement that the chinese communist party was emboldened. competition doesn't need to lead to confrontation. in fact, quite the opposite. and i think we have returned to arenas of competition involving countering more effectively china's campaign of sustained industrial espionage against us, countering a range of china's unfair trade and economic practices, doing so in large measure through effective international cooperation, for example, establishing better standards for infrastructure investment internationally, the law enforcement actions and investigations that have gone on against apt10.\\xa0\", \"the main hacking arm of the chinese communist party, i think have been very effective as well, combined with sanctions and other actions against the aggressive arms of the party. but really, i think the most important thing for us to do, and i argue this in a chapter battlegrounds entitled turning weakness into strength is to take what the chinese communist party sees as sources of weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strengths. what does the party fear? the party fears that the people, the chinese people, might want to have a say in how they're governed so we should strengthen our democratic processes. the party fears rule of law. we should strengthen rule of law in the united states and with countries that are working to strengthen rule of law in their countries, the party fears freedom of press, freedom of the expression. we need to strengthen our authoritative sources of information and recognize that investigative journalism is a great counter to some of these pernicious strategies that the parties are pursuing. so i think that part of it is defensive, but part of it is more introspective and trying to maintain our competitive advantages.\", \"michael morrell: this is intelligence matters. i'm michael morrell. we're talking with former national security adviser h.r. mcmaster. so russia, how do you think about russia?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, russia is a significant threat to us because putin again, is examining the assumptions of previous policies. putin is not going to become like the grinch on christmas eve. right, his heart is not going to get too big as the size gets bigger and he's not going to decide, ok, well maybe the future of russia does lie more with the west and treat the united states and europe and others differently. putin is driven by a sense of honor lost after the breakup of the soviet union. he is also driven by this associated desire to restore russia to national greatness. he's also cognizant, though, of the fact that he cannot compete with this on our own terms. and so what his theory of victory is, is to drag us all down and then to be the last man standing and the means that he's using to do this. i describe the chinese approach of cooption, coercion and concealment. and i use alliteration in the russian chapters as well.\\xa0\", 'it is a campaign of disruption, disinformation and denial to try to disrupt us, to disrupt our effective governance, to disrupt us economically and to use economic coercion when he can, such as he has done in europe effectively from time to time and with energy dependence. then to deny even his most egregious acts, especially the sustained campaign of cyber enabled information warfare against us, which is designed to polarize us, to pit us against each other, to reduce our confidence in who we are as a people and in our democratic institutions and principles and processes. russia is a dangerous threat for for these reasons. and the best way to counter the first step is to pull the curtain back on this activity, to educate ourselves about it, to be less susceptible to russian information, to not be our own worst enemies, as i think both political parties in many instances have because they compromise and they compromised our principles to score some partisan political points and in doing so, make themselves vulnerable to russian disinformation and propaganda.', 'michael morrell: then what about raising the cost to him of doing this? is that an option here in terms of deterring him?', \"gen. mcmaster: absolutely. this is what i advocated for in battlegrounds is that we have to impose costs on the kremlin, on putin, that exceed those that he factors in at the beginning of his decision making process. it was my last day really in an oval office meeting, it was the day that president trump decided to impose significant costs on russia in response to the attempted\\xa0 poisoning, murder of sergei skripal and his daughter with with a banned military grade nerve agent and an act that put thousands of uk citizens at risk. and it was at that on that occasion that we expelled you over 60 undeclared intelligence agents that hits putin where it matters. because these are agents that were critical to his sustained campaign of subversion against us. and we impose significant costs, additional costs on russia through sanctions and other actions, the closing of the san francisco consulate, as you know, michael, was a major intelligence collection platform for the russians here in silicon valley and the bay area. so, that was significant and i think that sent a strong message. now, after navalny's poisoning, i'd like to see us do the same thing, you know, and as he's infiltrating more little green men now into belarus and as he continues to enable the serial episodes of mass homicide, that is the syrian civil war, to support hawthorne's way perpetuating violence in libya.\\xa0\", \"michael morrell: i'm michael morell. we're talking with h.r. mcmaster, former national security adviser to president trump and author of the just published book \", \" by the way, if you missed any of today's show, you can listen to it as a podcast. just search \", \"wherever you get your podcasts. let's talk about north korea. give us your sense on north korea?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, thanks, michael. of course, it's important for us to recognize going in right that north korea is the only communist hereditary dictatorship in the world. and it is the nature of the kim family regime that we have to take into account when we're considering the danger that the regime poses to the world if it does possess the most destructive weapons on earth. the kim family regime is driven mainly by this drive to remain in power. it is, of course, known as the hermit kingdom. it is a gulag state that fears any kind of opening to the world. and it is a regime that across now three generations of dictators has been committed to unifying the korean peninsula under the so-called red banner. and i think as we look at north korea's pursuit of the most destructive weapons on earth, we have to be at least open to the possibility that it wants those weapons to coerce the united states off the peninsula as the first step in the forcible reunification of the peninsula. and, of course, that would that would be the form of a destructive war.\", \"gen. mcmaster: it's also important, i think, for us to recognize that it is highly unlikely that north korea wants nuclear weapons just to deter us. north korea already had a very significant deterrence capability with its conventional weapons. and the fact that it's so many thousands of artillery pieces are within the range of of seoul, south korea. and then also, i think it's important to recognize that every act of aggression on the korean peninsula since the north invaded the south in june of 1950 has been initiated by the north. the other aspect of this problem, michael, that is very important to consider is that if north korea gets the weapon is recognized as a as a nuclear power, like who doesn't get one after that? right. this japan starts to have conversation with south korea. by the way, north korea never met a weapon it didn't try to sell to somebody excluding its nuclear program until the israeli defense force bombed that facility in 2007. so it's very dangerous. i think it's dangerous as well because of the ideology that drives this regime. it's a warped ideology. this is the zushi ideology which has turned deprivation into a sign of virtue and racial superiority. and the north korean people have gone through generations of brainwashing. so this is a big problem, michael. i think that the approach that is in place now, the strategy of maximum pressure, it's the best course of action. i think we have to test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince kim jong un that he is safer without the weapons than he is with them. i think it will be important for whoever is sworn in on january 20th that they recognize that we should not repeat the failed pattern of previous efforts, not allow north korea to draw us into negotiations with an act of aggression and with the demands of big payoff up front just for the privilege of talking with them. to not again, engage in long, drawn out negotiations that delivers a weak agreement that he immediately breaks again.\", \"michael morrell: you've said something here that i think is really important, because i think the conventional wisdom is that he wants these weapons for deterrence. right. that he's worried about us attacking him. but you're arguing that it's more than that. that this gets to the heart of what north korea has always wanted, which is to reunify the peninsula, which i think is a really important point here that changes how you think about how you have to deal with him?\", \"gen. mcmaster: this is an argument, michael, for strategic empathy. right? to view these complex challenges from the perspective of the other and unless you do that,\\xa0 you're susceptible to mirror imaging. and, of course, my research for the book, \", ', you know that sensitized me to this. it was in the run up to the vietnam war where some of those who were planning the vietnam strategy development, the strategy actually referred to the reasonable man theory of english common law and assumed that ho chi minh would respond as the theoretical reasonable man. would respond without taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played in driving and constraining the north vietnamese leadership.', \"michael morrell: do you think at the end of the day it's possible to convince him that he would be better off, that he would be more secure without these weapons?\", \"gen. mcmaster: i do think it's possible, and the reason i think it's possible because we've never really put maximum pressure on the north. and so we have this opportunity now thanks really to the tremendous work by ambassador nikki haley when she was at the u.n. as you know, michael, these u.n. security council sanctions on north korea are unprecedented and reach. the key now, though, is to enforce them. of course, the key country that needs to enforce them is china. and i think if china doesn't enforce them, if china continues to be complicit with illicit financial flows into and out of the country, to continue to provide energy and other materials to the north that are limited by these sanctions. then i think it's time for us to consider secondary sanctions and maybe on chinese financial institutions.\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think as we see the smuggling of coal and the transshipment of coal and oil and fuel, i think that under article two, i think the president could use article two authority to interdict those ships. as you know, michael, this is something we can't really talk about. there are other means of putting pressure on the north. i think that we haven't done it yet. i think we have to at least test the thesis because the alternatives are so bleak of either accepting north korea as a nuclear power and coping with that threat or a war. right. that would be very costly, i think it's worth pursuing.\", \"michael morrell: we still have more to discuss with general mcmaster and we'll be right back with our final segment.\\xa0\", \"michael morrell: we're back with more intelligence matters, i'm michael morrell. our guest is h.r. mcmaster, senior fellow at both stanford university's hoover institution and its graduate school of business. so, sir, let me ask you about another tough one, iran.\", 'gen. mcmaster: on iran, what i tell the story of in ', \", michael, is we have to view the problem of iran with two fundamental considerations foremost in our minds. the first is the ideology of the revolution and how that drives iranian leadership and the iranian leadership is the supreme leader and the guardian council and the islamic revolutionary guards corps. we have this fantasy i think that the reformers, the republicans, within iraq are going to prevail. they lost, the revolutionaries are in charge. the hardliners are in charge. and whenever they put this forward, the shop window of minister zarif, their foreign minister or president rouhani, that's all you're getting is the shop window. that ideology is it drives the iranian regime to continue its four decade long proxy war against the great satan, the united states, the little satan, israel, the arab monarchies and the west broadly. and so we have to consider the ideology of the regime and and this 40 year long proxy war.\", \"gen. mcmaster: what i argue for in the book is to force the iranian regime to make a choice. you can either be treated like a normal nation or you can continue to wage this proxy war, to support terrorist organizations and keep the middle east enmeshed in this perpetual state of sectarian civil war. the choice is yours, and to impose that choice, i think what we should not do is lift the arms embargo to the regime. what we should not do is lift any of the sanctions. in fact, we should impose the costs on the regime to constrain the resources they have available to continue their proxy wars against us, but then also ultimately maybe to convince the iranian people. that they ought to have a government in place and i'm not talking about like a 2003 regime change, but a government in place that shifts away from its permanent hostility to the united states, israel and the west. i think that's the only path that i see forward. i think our policies ought to aim to effect that change in the regimes permanent hostility. and until it does any agreement with them, it can't be trusted and any agreement with them that allows them to escape. making that choice like the iran nuclear deal did, i think is to our disadvantage.\", \"michael morrell: so you don't see the regime changing policy on its own. do you think that has to be forced internally by the iranian people? is that fair?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, michael, i think on iran, it's important to keep two considerations in mind in crafting a strategy toward iran. first of all, that it's the ideology of the regime that drives their hostile behavior toward us. and we have to recognize that it's the supreme leader, it's the guardian council, its islamic revolutionary guards corps, who are in charge. right. there was a struggle, you know, across the history of iran since the revolution in 1979 between the republicans and the revolutionaries. hey, the revolutionaries won. and and we have to recognize that the second consideration is that this regime has waged a four decade long proxy war against the great satan, us, the little satan, israel, the arab monarchies and the west generally. we have to craft our strategy in recognition of this regime's permanent hostility to us. of course, i think the best way to approach it in the title of the chapter in \", 'is ', \", forcing the regime to make a choice of either being a responsible nation and then being treated as such or suffering the consequences. and this is why i think it's very important to keep the arms embargo in place. i think it's very important to keep the sanctions in place on the regime to, in the short term, reduce the resources it has available to wage this proxy war and in the long term, hopefully convince the iranian people to demand a change in the nature of the government such that it ceases as permanent hostility.\", \"michael morrell: okay, islamic extremism, it's waned a bit in the threat, but it's still there. from west africa, to the middle east, to south asia, to southeast asia. how do you think about that problem long term?\\xa0\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think the reason that we haven't had another attack on the scale of the most devastating terrorist attack in history of september 11th, 2001, is our tremendous intelligence professionals, our diplomats, our military who's been engaged against this threat from jihadist terrorist organizations since 9/11. what i'm concerned about, michael, is that these groups, i think are more dangerous today than they were maybe even on september 10th, 2001. and that's because, of course, those who committed the mass murder attacks against us on 9/11 were the mujahideen alumni of the resistance to the soviet occupation of afghanistan. well, now the al-qaida alumni, the isis alumni, the lashkar-e-taiba alumni are orders of magnitude greater and they have access to more and more destructive capabilities. and the reason we've been safe is because we've been engaged and now we have this narrative of ending endless wars and disengaging. well, i think what americans need to know is that we are engaged so we can enable others to bear the brunt of this fight. i mean, this disengagement from afghanistan, i think is a tragedy. the way that we've gone about this, i think we should recognize the sacrifices of our longest war and in particular that 10 of our courageous servicemen, soldiers, gave their lives for our country, our security this year. but we have to also recognize that 30 afghan soldiers and police a day die defending the freedoms that they've enjoyed since the defeat of the taliban in 2001 a removal of the taliban from power. so i think that we need to make a sustained argument to the american people for engagement with this problem of jihadist terrorism. because if we don't, michael, we'll go back to 1998. remember when we after the embassy bombings, we fired a few cruise missiles and called it a day. right, that didn't work out.\", \"michael morrell: the last issue i want to ask you about is venezuela, which i know you care about. my understanding is that when you arrived at the white house, you were going over the issues and you kind of stumbled on venezuela and said, hey, you know what's going on there? that doesn't look like we're paying attention to this, talk about venezuela and why it's important?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, it's immensely important because this is a humanitarian catastrophe in venezuela. it's a humanitarian catastrophe that's brought on by an authoritarian regime that is denying the venezuelan people a say in how they're governed. when we looked at the problem and the nature of the maduro regime and the chavista movement, we concluded that this was, again, a corrupt government that is using criminalized patronage networks to effect control of its people. it uses these motorcycle gangs and militias to overwhelm any kind of opposition. it ended the constitution. so we said what's should our goal be? our goal should be to work with others, to work with like-minded countries, to effect a restoration of constitutional rule in venezuela. and to do that, we felt as if we had to pursue three objectives. one of those objectives would be to try to strengthen the opposition. right. to help the opposition come together. i think you saw that with the rise of bolsonaro. you know, who was really from the people. you know, he's not a member of the caracas polo club, for example. i think he's somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged now so significantly under chávez, and now maduro.\", \"gen. mcmaster: the second objective would be for the people to be able to attribute their grievances back to the government, not to blame the yankees, you know, for example. and the third related to that would be to try to galvanize really popular support for restoration of constitutional government. i think the measures we put in place were sound. of course, they have proven inadequate. and i think we thought that economic sanctions would maybe have a significant effect. but the reason they haven't had a bigger effect is there's a huge black market, illicit economy that's run by maduro. he uses that to sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gangs of thugs who really prevent any real opposition from gaining traction. but i think i'm proud of what we did in this period of time. we worked very closely with partners, especially in the western hemisphere, mexico, under the foreign minister of the great luis videgaray, who was a wonderful partner, took a leading role in much of the work that we did. we try'd to get the organization of american states and others to do more. but it was really the community of like-minded nations brazil, colombia, peru, panama, argentina. we worked very closely together on this problem and i think remain committed to trying to effect a restoration of constitutional government in venezuela.\", \"michael morrell: you've been fantastic with your time. i just want to ask you two more questions, we have a couple of minutes left, so we'll need to be quick here.\", \"michael morrell: the first is that in order to deal with all of these problems that you've talked about, you know, we need a healthy national security toolkit. healthy diplomacy, healthy intelligence capabilities, healthy military capabilities. what's your assessment sort of overall of where we are with our national security toolkit?\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think we're in good shape thanks to the extremely dedicated civil servants and military professionals, intelligence professionals who we have across our government. but i think what is needed more than anything is a higher degree of what i argue in \", \" is, strategic competence, and that's the ability to integrate the elements of national power so that they're applied in a way that are synergistic. the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. i think at times we get it right, but most often we get it wrong. and our approach to these complex problems is fragmented. it's inconsistent. it's as i mentioned, you know, based on flawed assumptions about the nature of the problem. i think what i would like to see as well these days is even more of a concerted effort to foster multinational cooperation as i write in \", \". i mean, none of these problems are solvable by any one country. so it's very important for us to create the right venues for us to come together. not only to work on a discrete issue or event together, but really to think about these complex challenges. to frame them together and then to apply our competitive advantages between our like minded countries. so that we do have a synergistic effect and and so that we can build a better future for generations to come.\", \"michael morrell: the last question, i think anybody who's listened to the podcast up to this point is going to think, wow, that is a hard, tough list. i wonder at the end of the day, if you're optimistic or if you are pessimistic that we're going to get this right going forward.\", \"gen. mcmaster: michael, i'm optimistic about it. i'm optimistic about it even as we emerge from this\\xa0 triple crisis. of the pandemic, the recession associated with it and the divides in our society, laid bare by george floyds murder and the protests and civil unrest that followed it. i think what's great about our democracy is we are self-correcting. the american people have a say in how they're governed. they can demand better. and the reason i wrote \", \" is i think if the american people understand these challenges, they will demand a better foreign policy from from our elected leaders. you know, our founders knew that our democracy was going to require continuous nurturing. it's still true today. and i believe that we do have significant problems at home. but we also have to confront these challenges abroad because we know from the covid-19 pandemic that problems that develop abroad can only be dealt with at an exorbitant price once they reach our shores. so the argument of battlegrounds is an argument for sustained engagement with the world.\", 'michael morrell: the book is ', \".' the author is h.r. mcmaster. general, thank you very much for joining us today.\", 'gen. mcmaster: michael, thank you for

york times was getting ready to report on ', ' that attempted to sabotage north korea’s missile programs with cyberstrikes. “is this the revelation of the modern-day enigma codes?” he asked, the military historian searching for an analogy from the world war ii operation to crack german ciphers.', 'it was a bracing start for what turned out to be a wild 13-month effort to devise a modern-day security strategy for a president with no experience, more interest in cutting deals than designing a long-term strategy — and an unwillingness to sit for intelligence briefings, much less discussion of containing an angry, decaying russia or of a 50-year plan to compete with a rising china. so “battlegrounds” is, at its heart, the mcmaster strategic plan that might have come to fruition had he worked for a president who was interested in strategic plans.', 'long before he walked into the west wing, mcmaster was the closest thing the army had to a soldier-scholar. his book about vietnam, ', ' was a devastating account of how the united states had a flawed decision-making process that was largely based on self-deception.', 'in many ways, “battlegrounds” is the sequel, seeking to ask the question of why — not whether — the united states, at another moment of protests in the streets and bitter partisan divides, is losing its ability to shape the world. but the answers this time are different, in mcmaster’s view.', 'the key to his argument is that america is suffering from what hans morgenthau called “strategic narcissism,” or, in mcmaster’s words, “the tendency to view the world only in relation to the united states and to assume that the future course of events depends primarily on u.s. decisions or plans.” it’s hard to argue with that premise: every new president comes to office assuming that the world is waiting for direction from washington. some countries are. others are looking for power vacuums they can fill, each in its own way.', 'that’s been the story of the past two decades. russia has emerged as a disrupter, knowing that it has neither the money nor the technology to take the united states on directly. china has become a builder — why threaten to cut undersea cables, as vladimir putin’s submarine force does, if you can dominate global communications? as rob joyce, an n.s.a. official who worked for mcmaster as the white house cybersecurity coordinator, said: “russia is the hurricane. … china is climate change.”', 'mcmaster realized that, and devoted much of his time in the west wing to writing a “national security strategy” that would reorient the united states away from nearly two decades of counterterrorism and toward countering moscow and beijing, which he called “revisionist powers.” it was an impressive document. unfortunately, the president under whose name it was published, aides concede, did not read it.', '“battlegrounds” expands on the written strategy — the one the white house has barely mentioned since it was published — and makes a strong case for containing russia, pushing back on chinese influence and using american leverage, and allies, to confront iran and north korea. what washington needs, mcmaster argues, is an integrated approach that recognizes that the old tools that drove saddam hussein out of kuwait in 1991, when mcmaster served, are pretty useless 30 years later.', 'he starts with russia. “the united states and europe were ill prepared for russia’s toxic combination of disinformation, denial, dependence and disruptive technologies,” he says, a recognition that what happened in 2016 was not that america’s radar was off. it’s that the radar was never built. fortunately, it has since been pieced together, and in the 2020 presidential contest, everyone from facebook to twitter to the united states cyber command has been pushing back. disinformation has been blocked, clumsily. ', ', at least briefly.', 'unfortunately, mcmaster’s boss was not on board with this approach. in mcmaster’s time, he notes, president trump often said improving relations with russia “would be a good thing, not a bad thing,” while succumbing to putin’s flattery and treating his criminal actions “with dismissiveness and moral equivalency.” and, of course, the repeated references to “the russia hoax,” which meant no one in the president’s circle could discuss election interference without dreading an eruption triggered by trump’s fear that the legitimacy of the election was being questioned.', 'mcmaster never deals head-on with the fundamental problem — that the administration had, on paper, a defensible russia strategy, and the president kept undermining it. instead, he cites his top russia aide, fiona hill, who, he writes, always warned that “putin seeks to divide; americans and europeans should not divide themselves.”', 'china, the climate-changer, is, of course, immune to containment strategies. if the old cold war was largely a military contest, version 2.0 is a military, diplomatic, economic and technological contest. that change led to a misappraisal of the challenge: as mcmaster points out, a succession of administrations convinced themselves that, over time, china would conform to a western-built system. (trump succumbed to a different illusion: that the chinese were all dealmakers, like the property developers he knew.)', 'crucial to mcmaster’s analysis is china’s strategy to wire together its own collection of allies and dependent powers — selling them controlled-in-china technology, from huawei’s networks to, after mcmaster departed, tiktok’s addictive app.', '“it took the united states a decade and a half to understand the immensity of the trojan horse it had let in,” he says of how the united states blindly let a chinese telecommunications giant gain ground, while american firms exited the market. but the reader yearns for mcmaster’s solution. ban chinese technology? maybe — president trump is trying — but even then china will dominate 40 percent or more of the world’s telecommunications networks. embrace an industrial policy that will win back the market?', 'it is in dealing with the two biggest failures of the trump administration, iran and north korea, that mcmaster sounds the loudest alarms. while he was a major critic of president obama’s 2015 nuclear deal with tehran, and criticizes obama’s aides for overlooking iran’s support of terrorism and terrorist regimes, he reports that internally he argued for staying inside the deal and using trump’s threats to toss it aside as leverage.', 'but the president wouldn’t think that many chess moves ahead, and dispensed with the whole deal a month after mcmaster left. now he fears that the united states, without allies to confront iran, may slip into the place we are with other nuclear powers that washington once declared could never possess nuclear arms:', '“pakistan provides a stark warning. iran could become, like pakistan today, a nuclear-armed state in which terrorists already enjoy a support base. the greatest threat to humanity in the coming decades may lie at the nexus between terrorists and the most destructive weapons on earth.”', 'north korea, of course, already has those weapons — and a lot more fuel for them now than when the trump administration arrived with its threats of “fire and fury” if they were not turned over immediately. it was the president’s ego that got in the way.', 'mcmaster knew, he says, that as soon as kim jong-un proposed a summit, the president “would find a historic first meeting between a north korean leader and a u.s. president irresistible.” not a single weapon or missile has been dismantled. but the sanctions regime is in tatters, undercut by russia and china.', 'which takes me back to mcmaster’s question his first day: are we facing the “modern-day enigma codes”? it turns out the enigma this time is us. americans want the unrivaled power, the global influence, and the economic growth and freedom that come with it, the kind we enjoyed with little challenge at the end of world war ii and then, briefly, after the collapse of the soviet union. but we want it free — without the strategic investments in the world, without forward-deployed troops, without marshaling the power of technologies america largely invented.', 'the biggest of mcmaster’s “battlegrounds” is here at home.', 'advertisement']['from ', ' to

institute for scholars, president vladimir putin and his top advisers only have themselves to blame for these crises on russia’s periphery, given their active assertion of “veto rights” over political outcomes that they find unfavorable, including any signs that a country is realigning away from russia and toward the west.', 'in many cases, this has meant staunch russian support for friendly authoritarian regimes in post-soviet states, leading to mass demonstrations or other forms of unrest. “in a way,” rojansky told wpr’s elliot waldman in an interview on the trend lines podcast this

missile that is reported to have a reach of 54nm (100km). in theory, if a fourth-generation fighter like the rafale has an aesa radar and is armed with a beyond-visual-range missile like the meteor it ought to be able to see and hit incoming russian aircraft, while staying out of reach itself.', 'however, beside the addition of aesa on the rafales, other european fourth-generation aircraft lack the advanced radar.', '“uncertainties remain as to which nations will invest in aesa radar technology, advanced and long-range munitions, and secure communication links, among other important capabilities,” says rand. “the degree to which european air forces acquire these technologies will directly impact their ability to contribute to the range of combat air missions expected in a high-intensity conflict.”', 'for its part, the uk royal air force announced in september plans to add the ecrs mk2 aesa radar to 40 examples of its tranche 3 production-standard typhoons, with initial operational capability targeted for 2025.', 'ultimately, to make the most of a mixed fleet of fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft nato will need to invest in communications technologies to link the jets, as well as training exercises to practice coordinating the combat aircraft.', 'f-35’s can communicate among themselves with their multifunction advanced data link (madl), a low probability of intercept communications link. rand points to a fourth and fifth generation fighter operating concept called “combat intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (isr) mode” described by justin bronk of the royal united services institute think tank.', '“in the ‘combat isr’ mode, a four-ship flight of f-35s connected by madl generates situational awareness and shares targeting data with legacy platforms that can then fire their payloads from outside the range of the most capable of the enemy’s air defences,” explains rand. the fourth- and fifth-generation combat aircraft would communicate and pass targeting information with the link 16 system, adds the report.', 'however, this might be a vulnerability point. “it is reasonable to assume that the russian military would seek to disrupt this synergy during a conflict, particularly in light of recent russian investments in ew capabilities,” rand says.', 'still, european nato militaries are getting more practice with the f-35. “already, allies have undertaken initial steps to establish common tactics, techniques, and procedures for incorporating fifth-generation assets into combined operations through targeted exercises as well as preliminary synthetic training systems that link fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft,” the think tank says.', 'one of the highest hurdles to nato collaboration might be investment in aircraft readiness. “to be operationally relevant during a theatre conflict, nato’s air forces must maintain a sufficient number of available aircraft, munitions, and aircrew,” says rand. “currently, most european air forces maintain around half of their existing fleets or less at mission-capable status, with some allies falling below that mark.”', 'what’s more, many fourth-generation aircraft are suffering from “rising maintenance costs from platform age, operational wear and tear resulting from a high operational tempo, and challenges associated with spare parts pipelines serve as significant constraints to aircraft availability”, says the report.', 'the new f-35 also has teething problems, including its autonomic logistics information system, a support system that is so troubled that it has to be replaced across the worldwide fleet.', 'rand recommends a number of solutions to nato aircraft readiness problems including making public data on mission capable rates. it also suggests “public agreement by nato leaders on standard availability objectives could provide renewed political and budgetary focus on efficient and adequately funded maintenance and sustainment”.', 'ultimately, rand concludes that the growing number of stealth aircraft in europe means the “trend lines lead in the right direction”.', '“with additional budgetary and policy attention to increasing readiness, european allies have the opportunity to significantly enhance combat airpower over the coming decade,” says the think tank.', 'the dod had expressed confidence as recently as august that

2014. still, up until last summer, germany has been looking for topics on which it could engage with russia, in the hopes that keeping the lines of communication open would have some good effects and help make the world a safer place.', 'none of these approaches has worked recently. this is because, in a world in flux, moscow sees them all as fleeting theoretical constructs that are not fit to invest in, let alone build on. russian policymakers dismiss the lithuanian theory as a fantasy based on past dreams: moscow does not believe in the normative framework that forms its basis and, if it did, would fight against it.', 'the french theory goes nowhere because moscow does understand who macron speaks for: himself, france, or europe. moscow sees his ideas as unrealistic and domestically driven. and, in any case, russia has no intention of limiting its freedom of action by prematurely siding with europe, especially given that it does not know whether the european union will become a policy actor to reckon with – or even if it is here to stay.', 'russia’s scepticism about europe may also explain the dismal fate of the german theory. moscow has recently allowed its disputes with berlin to pile up in ways that may cost it its best european friend – apparently just because it does not care to save or invest in a relationship with germany and, by implication, europe.', 'the us election result will affect the relative standing of these theories. a biden win might embolden the lithuanian theory, put the french theory on the defensive, and, depending on the circumstances, lend new energy to germany’s attempts to create patches of common ground in the west’s otherwise normatively adversarial relationship with russia (not to be confused with appeasement, which is a different thing entirely). proponents of each theory would seek to strengthen it by coordinating and cooperating with a biden administration, and they would want to help the new president succeed using their favoured approach (which would be different from trump’s). but, even so, moscow would likely remain reluctant to buy into any of this.\\xa0', 'this is not to say that it does not matter to russia who wins the us election. moscow does not have great expectations regarding either president, but the outcome will nonetheless have an impact on russia’s view on the direction the world is heading in. a second trump presidency would validate what, according to some russian experts, has always been putin’s world view: “instinctively, he is nationalist, unilateralist, and transactional”, ', ' one russian analyst in december 2018. “for him, this is how the world works, and he wants to be vindicated. he wants to be able to tell the west he has always been right.”', 'a biden win would clash with this view. it would show the kremlin that the normative ideas that have underpinned the western policies are not dead; that they might make a comeback and, importantly, adapt to new realities. but adaptation cannot be taken for granted, and would inevitably take time. so, in either case, moscow will continue to see us policies as provisional – as a part of a temporary phase that one needs to wait out, to see what follows. moscow would view trump as a destroyer of the liberal system – and would welcome this – but not as an architect of a new system that it could engage with. and moscow would inevitably suspect a biden presidency of being just the last gasp of the former liberal consensus.', 'the more biden urged a restoration of obama-era policies – not to mention those of the clinton era – the more moscow would see his actions as the death throes of a dying order and, as such, something to resist or ignore. conversely, the stronger biden proved in acknowledging that the world had changed, and that western policy needed to change too, the more seriously moscow would take him as a figure who could shape the future.', 'the task is to find a way of shaping the world – including influencing russia – in the circumstances where the western ‘unipolar’ moment of the 1990s has passed, and even 500 years of relative western hegemony might be drawing to a close. this takes humility, caution, and a clear head. emotionally driven policies and rushed solutions do not fit. in a seminal study exploring the lessons that the soviet collapse might offer to the european union, ivan krastev ', ' that, “in times of threats of disintegration, political actors should bet on flexibility and constrain their natural urge for rigidity and solutions intended to last (which, if and when they fail, can accelerate the momentum to disintegration).” this applies to the disintegration of the international order as well. attempts to forcefully recreate yesterday’s order will almost certainly lead to its final discreditation. efforts to build something new, forcefully and prematurely, will be stillborn. a fruitful policy requires a humble mindset and an understanding that, to shape the world order, the west needs to start at home, by making its own societies work; by remaking them. this will take time – but it has a chance of working.', '\\nthe european council on foreign

last saw each other at the beginning of this year in january. among other things, it’s prevented me from going to st. petersburg in my first 10 or 11 months as ambassador, which i was looking forward to. i haven’t been there since 1988. and i was looking forward to visiting the hermitage, among other things.', 'so you’ve referenced this grant that we’ve made through the ambassadors fund for cultural preservation to support the hermitage. and i can give you a little bit a little bit of detail on that. the project is actually a partnership among four organizations. there’s this ambassador’s fund for cultural preservation, which is part of the state department’s bureau of educational and cultural affairs. that’s one. and then there’s our role at the u.s. embassy. and you mentioned the hermitage foundation, which is based in new york city. and then finally, there’s the state hermitage museum in st. petersburg. and among all four of these, these organizations, we came together to come up with a project to restore three frescoes of the raphael school as part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the death of raphael.', 'and that’s what we’re focused on. these frescoes were painted between 1523 and 1524, on the wall of a villa in italy, and they were actually acquired by the hermitage in 1860. but over the past 500 years, the frescoes have suffered considerable exposure to the elements and prior restoration efforts were imperfect. so the program that we’re sponsoring, is to restore those frescoes which is urgently needed. and as i say it’s done in connection with the 500th anniversary of raphael’s death. and we’re hopeful that after they’re restored, that there will be really an unveiling of the true beauty of the frescoes not just to the russian public, but to the world. which is, you know, the hermitage museum is, of course, a cultural treasure of russia, but really, of the world. i mean, the hermitage is such a – literally – a treasure of art and culture.', 'so with this grant we’re doing, the program is done – we’ve been working with the executive director of the hermitage foundation and i want to credit her, saranna biel-cohen [working] on behalf of the foundation, and of course the director of the hermitage museum, mikhail piotrovsky. i want to credit them for their hard work on this project. and next week on october 28, the foundation, the museum, and myself, the embassy, will have a virtual launch of the project, and anybody, any of your readers or you, if you’re interested, it’ll be at 5pm on wednesday, the 28th. and we’ll learn more about the frescoes, how they’ll be restored, and the cultural significance.', ' very good. and could you say a couple of words about this ambassador’s fund for cultural preservation? as i understand it is a deliberate foundation to preserve treasures cultural treasures throughout the world.', ' yes, indeed, it was established, [nineteen] years ago [in 2001]. it’s a program that’s operated in over 100 countries. and it’s managed out of the state department in washington. and there is a process to review proposals and get approval from the department of state to provide the funding. so this program that we submitted on behalf of the hermitage foundation and the hermitage, was in a competition against hundreds of other proposals from other u.s. embassies worldwide. and the fact that this project won this grant is a sign both of the significance of the project itself, and of the cultural partnership between the united states and russia. and this will be i think, the [seventh] project that we have funded in russia over the last 20 years or so. so it’s an important sign of the cultural bonds between the united states and russia', ' very good. you’re lucky that you prepared the good papers. and we are lucky, of course, russians that this will be restored. and may i ask you some questions about other cultural people to people, so to say, relations between russia and america, like sisters cities program, or the u.s.-russia business cooperation, or cooperation in space, arctic, because there are a lot of dimensions of coexistence, rather only all the military and strategic ones.', ' well, konstantin, you’re absolutely right. and i would say, you know, there are relations between the u.s. government and the government of the russian federation, whether it’s on strategic and military issues, political issues, and we all know how fraught those relations have been over the last several years in particular. but there’s a much broader relationship between the united states and russia between our peoples, including cultural and educational exchanges, in business, in space, in the arctic, and a small topic that i like to emphasize, but my colleagues here at the embassy are probably sick of hearing me talk about – ice hockey – which is a personal interest of mine. but it’s those connections, i think, konstantin that are among the most significant that we have. and they are a bond that keeps us together, when the political situation seems most dire. and one thing i’ve observed in my tenure here is how much the relationship between the united states and russia has changed, just in my professional lifetime.', 'you know, i came i mentioned earlier in our conversation that i visited st. petersburg in 1988. i was a private u.s. citizen had a great interest in russia and russian history. i visited moscow, what was then leningrad, but i visited the soviet union then, and i visited leningrad, not st. petersburg. and if you think of all that’s happened in our relationship between our two countries over the last 30 to 35 years, how things have changed, the ups and downs, what’s grown has been the cultural, business, all of those ties between our two peoples that have grown dramatically.', 'and that distinguishes this era, from that sort of late soviet era that i grew up in, in the 70s and 80s, when we didn’t have those many ties that keep us together, when the political sea gets choppy. so now, for example, we have more than 1,000 u.s. businesses invested in doing business here in russia. and that means russians and americans working together. it’s not just the bolshoi traveling to new york and performing in new york city, or, you know, an equivalent theatre company coming from the united states and performing here. it is day to day personal interaction between colleagues in business. and that’s significant. and it provides a little more ballast for the relationship, when, as i say, the political seas, can get choppy.', 'but as those of us who are old enough, with some perspective, can look back over the last three or four decades and see how our relationship has changed. our counterparts 20 or 30 years from now, the u.s. ambassador and your successor, you know, i’m sure they’ll be remarking too on how much things have changed since 2020. and the relationship between the united states and russia remember those dark old days with, you know, with ukraine – crimea – and syria, and libya, and nagorno-karabakh, and belarus, and election interference and cyber this – and god knows what our successors are going to be talking about 35 years from now. but what i will say is, the fact that we have made the connections that we’ve made over the last 30 or 35 years in business, in the arts, in sports and entertainment, will make it more likely that it’s a positive outcome and more positive developments. not just focused on the day to day negativity.', ' yeah, you mentioned the amazing figure that a thousand u.s. businesses are dealing with russia, despite all the sanctions and all the risks connected with sanctions. and our cooperation between military in syria also exist and they exchange information. so i really share your view that the infrastructure of many, many spheres of interrelations is a good support to these big politics.', ' and part of that, you’re absolutely right, a part of that infrastructure is something you mentioned, konstantin – sister city partnerships. we’ve got a large number. this is a program that’s been in existence for decades, established by and managed by the u.s. government. so there’s an official u.s. government relationship that’s involved here.', '[note: sister cities international is a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) nonprofit which serves as the national membership organization for individual sister cities, counties, and states across the united states. sister cities international was created at president eisenhower’s 1956 white house summit on citizen diplomacy. but it is an independent, nongovernmental organization. end note.]', 'but these sister city relationships, you know, date back into soviet times, into the 1970s when i think the first five sister city relationships happened. and now, you know, we’ve got cities all across the united states that are joined with cities across russia, so sarasota, florida and vladimir, for example. burlington, vermont and yaroslavl, louisville, kentucky and perm, chicago and moscow. and it’s, you know, it’s a small thing, but it’s an important part of our relationship. and, i’d also make the link with business as well, konstantin, because what we’ve done here at the embassy, and my colleagues at the u.s. department of commerce, and our counterparts at the ministry of trade, is that we have made connections, business-to-business connections, with regions and cities in the united states.', 'because of covid, we had to do this virtually, but we were planning a trade mission from texas – texas companies and the government of the state of texas – to the yekaterinburg in the ural region. we had to do it because of covid, we did it virtually, but it was a full day event. the government of the state of texas was involved, the governor of the state himself. and making those types of regional connections for business, i think is a is a profitable way forward. and i’ve spoken to secretary ross, our secretary of commerce, about this. and i know that the secretary himself had a phone call recently with trade minister manturov. and that’s an area where we’re going to continue to pursue making those connections regionally, as well, not just government-to-government.', ' very important, because a lot of asymmetric information is available in regions. people wants to do something, but they lack adequate information. so thank you for that effort in yekaterinburg, because it’s our industrial, i think, number three or number four, city in russian. do you have any plans for cooperation in the arctic because arctic seems to attract attention.', ' yes, it’s a very relevant and timely topic in our relationship, konstantin, because, as you know, russia will take over the chair of the arctic council in just a few months in 2021. and the arctic council is a very important institution that promotes this vital region, as a zone of cooperation free from conflict. and the council itself is an institution where we can discuss sustainable development, the environment, protection and development of indigenous peoples. and it’s a shared interest of the united states, russia – russia, of course, has a huge chunk of the arctic region within its northern border – but the united states, canada, the other members of the countries that border the arctic region, we all have a shared interest in its development and its protection. and so my colleagues in washington and our embassy here have been engaged directly with the russian government, with the ministry of foreign affairs in particular. i met with first deputy foreign minister titov a couple of months ago, to talk about arctic cooperation and russia’s role assuming the chair of the arctic council. and those discussions have continued between our two governments, between washington and moscow, and the pace of interaction will increase as we get closer to 2021 when russia does assume the chair.', 'okay, thank you. and the last question, but our younger audience is always interested about student exchange. and now with covid, a lot of zoom classes may have. but still, what is number of russians which are enrolled in american universities and colleges?', 'well, terrific question. and i could guess, off the top of my head, but what i’m going to propose is that we get back to you with the precise figures for your publication.', '[note: the latest open doors report shows that for the 2018-2019 academic year, more than 5,000 russians studied in the us. we do not have the figures for current enrollment in online programs. end note.]', 'but what i would offer, konstantin, is we had – i participated in a virtual program, that the united states government, that we the embassy helped organize. we usually do it in person, we bring over representatives from colleges and universities in the united states. and they come here to russia, to moscow to other cities, and they’re available to russian families, russian students, parents, who are interested in having a student study in the united states. because of covid, we weren’t able to do that in person. we did it virtually.', 'but here’s the benefit, though, of that, if there’s a silver lining, we got many more u.s. colleges and universities able to participate virtually, who wouldn’t have been able to, to send either afford to or couldn’t send somebody, to participate in a program in in moscow. so what that meant was that the russian students and their families that were interested and participated got a wide variety of much wider variety of u.s. colleges and universities presented and interested in recruiting them to study in the united states. and i know you yourself studied at penn. i won’t embarrass you by saying how many years ago it was, but i was long out of college myself by then. so we’re, neither of us is a youngster anymore. but you yourself can testify to the benefit of study abroad, and getting to know another country, and seeing how their education system works.', 'and i know a number of my colleagues here at the embassy, have studied at russian institutions, russian language, russian culture. so it’s a key component, and has been for a long time, and we’re really looking to, to encourage that. and it’s always fun to meet russians who have studied in the united states and compare notes about their experience, with our expectations. i will say, and these were, these were my remarks, and i wasn’t just trying to flatter the russian participants. it’s a fact that we hear from us colleges and universities, that russian students are among the most desired, are the most serious, hardworking, and just great additions to the student body, which isn’t this surprise for those of us who know or aspire to know, to know russia. it’s an important part of our relationship, the broader relationship between our two peoples. and we certainly want to encourage it, and we’re doing all we can, in the face of the covid pandemic, to make sure that those relationships continue, and that they don’t wither or diminish just because we’re not able to have in person interaction. so my hope is that we’ll have a large number of russian students traveling to the united states and enriching our schools and our campuses as you did in the 80s in philadelphia.', '\\xa0thank you. and i, personally, i am very grateful to you for supporting this students’ exchange. because, you know, if you live in the country, it is so difficult to influence you, in pushing any misperceptions, [to engage you in a] witch hunt. and it helps to understand the nature of people. and since 33 years ago, i returned back from philadelphia. you know, i keep this interest towards america i read every day american papers, i read american books, i watch american television, i watched the debate. \\xa0tonight i put down notes, who said what, what is the argument of that.', 'and this is something very profound in our sympathy and relations and desire to improve it. because i belong to that part of russian society, and i always openly said at every level that we believe that good relations with america can benefit russian people in medicine, in science, in culture, in sports, in engineering, in business, benefit it. it could be rather selfish from this point of view, but it is beneficial. it’s not hostile. and i wish that you in your position of ambassador put all your efforts, pursue the line in these dark, dark days of covid and the distraction of regular relationships.', ' oh, you’re so right. and i had a great experience a few months ago now. and i can add to all of the categories you listed, law and the legal profession. so i spoke to law students. it was probably a couple of hundred. it was a virtual, a virtual event i did it by zoom or some other electronic means which my colleagues are much better able to describe and make function than i. i just sit in front of the camera and talk. but what was fascinating was, for many of those students, i was the first american that they really had a chance to engage with in their young lives. and we had a lot in common. we talked about our legal education. some of their professors were on the call. and we got to share a few comments about law professors, and what it was like joining a profession, what their expectations were. and it’s just an example in our lives. i know we’ve both experienced this.', 'russians and americans, there are so many things that we have in common, whether we’re engineers, or ballet dancers, or hockey players, or authors, or lawyers. people are people, and the more that we can have these exchanges, trade experiences, explore how our systems are different and how they’re similar. it breaks down stereotypes, and it just makes things between our two countries, makes the relationship stronger, and makes it more difficult for political winds to blow the relationship in a really dangerous direction. the more we understand each other, the better we’ll be able to overcome some of these differences which would separate us now.', 'yeah, thank you, mr. ambassador. do you know what i noticed that what you talked today was actually about the substance of russian-american relations, because usually, a lot of experts view the need of russia to america and vice versa only as a means to solve some others country’s problems, like, we need russia to solve problem in north korea, or in iran, or in afghanistan, or it’s here, but it’s never a table which belongs to us. all spheres, which you mentioned, just belong to russia, and america, in every aspect. and i think it is most valuable in this relation that we have the body of mutual interest. and thank you for understanding that and pursuing this line.', 'well, you’re so right. and it’s not to diminish the importance of those geopolitical issues which i spend, you know, the vast amount of my time focused on and i know you write about, and we’re all interested in, and they’re extremely important to the world and global security and peace and prosperity. but if we’re talking about the united states and russia, it’s not just those issues. and our relationship has a long history. i was joking with the first deputy foreign minister titov, we were we were talking about the arctic. and i commented on the fact that i have to thank russia, then the russian empire, for giving the united states a stake in the arctic by selling us alaska. right?', 'so our relationship goes back a long, long way to when secretary of state seward purchased alaska, and made us a part of eventually the arctic council. but we shared a laugh over that. but it just an example of over time, the united states and russia, we have to deal with each other on these political issues, but on a broader level, people to people, we have stronger ties now than we did when i was growing up in the 60s and 70s, and 80s. people to people ties, educational, and so forth. the political issues are as challenging and maybe even more challenging in some ways than they were for my predecessors 40 or 50 years ago when it was the soviet union versus the west and the united states. but in any event, as long as we keep talking about positive things like this, it will give us more space to try to work out the more difficult political issues as well.', 'thank you very much for this interview and looking forward to talk with you on some other issues, maybe later, because there were a lot of substantial things you conveyed.\\xa0 it’s very important for our people, because they’re asymmetrically informed about the positions because they don’t understand how profound is your access to your job and your mission as ambassador here.', 'well, thank you, konstantin. i look forward to continuing this conversation, i hope in person soon but if not, continuing through zoom. so look forward to speaking again soon.',

navigation satellite to an orbit nearly 12,000 miles above earth on saturday.', 'the new satellite joins 24 active navigation spacecraft in the glonass fleet, russia’s analog to the u.s. military’s global positioning system.', 'the mission took off at 3:08:42 p.m. edt (1908:42 gmt) saturday aboard a russian soyuz-2.1b rocket from the plesetsk cosmodrome, a military-run launch base around 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of moscow, according to the russian ministry of defense.', 'liftoff occurred at 10:08 p.m. moscow time.', 'heading southeast from plesetsk, the soyuz rocket shed its four kerosene-fueled boosters around two minutes after liftoff, then jettisoned the aerodynamic shroud covering the glonass satellite after reaching space. the soyuz core stage shut down and separated around five minutes into the mission, followed by ignition of the third stage’s rd-0124 engine.', 'the third stage engine cut off about nine minutes after liftoff, and the mission’s fregat upper stage deployed to begin a series of maneuvers to place the glonass satellite its targeted orbit.', 'the fregat engine ignited three times to place the glonass payload into a circular orbit with\\xa0an altitude of more than 11,900 miles (19,100 kilometers) and an inclination of 64.8 degrees. the fregat upper stage released the glonass spacecraft around three-and-a-half hours after liftoff.', 'russian officials said the glonass satellite extended its solar panels, and ground teams established contact with the spacecraft. all systems on-board the satellite were functioning normally after launch saturday, officials said.', 'the payload launched saturday is the third spacecraft in russia’s glonass k series of navigation satellites, which engineers designed\\xa0to last longer and transmit more navigation signals. the first two glonass k satellites launched in 2011 and 2014.', 'the glonass k satellites weigh around 2,060 pounds, or 935 kilograms, somewhat less than the earlier generation glonass m satellites.', 'the glonass k satellite is expected to operate for 10 years — an improvement from the seven-year design life of previous satellites — and features five navigation channels, including a new civilian l-band signal. the new craft are lighter, generate more electrical power, and are based on an unpressurized express 1000k bus built by iss reshetnev\\xa0in\\xa0zheleznogorsk, russia.', 'the glonass k spacecraft will also support the international cospas-sarsat search and rescue network, russian officials said.', 'the satellite launched saturday also uses more russian-built equipment than previous glonass spacecraft, a change introduced to the glonass k design due to international sanctions on russia.', '“replacing the orbital constellation with glonass k spacecraft will ensure the stable operation of the russian navigation system and increase the accuracy of its navigation determinations up to tens of centimeters,” the russian defense ministry said in a statement.', 'as of monday, the glonass fleet consists of 24 active satellites, plus the new spacecraft launched saturday, and three more operating as a spare, undergoing maintenance, and performing fight tests. the network, which is run by the russian military but also used by civilians worldwide, requires 24 satellites in service spread among three orbital planes to provide global navigation coverage.', 'the russian ministry of defense was expected to name the new glonass satellite kosmos 2547, keeping with the naming scheme for russian military spacecraft.'\n"

eight year later openly sought reset in relation only to see his hope dashed finally with annexation of the ukrainian peninsula crimea in joe_biden who a obama vice_president supported the reset

dissent but candidate can thing during campaign and do something else once in office sometimes they have little choice because of circumstance or the course of event president joe_biden pursue a muscular an approach to a he ha suggested dont biden is going to fall head over heel to butter up putin david kramer who wa an assistant secretary of state in the administration of george bush moscow ha continued with disinformation campaign against him and so dont he going to extend hand and let nice added kramer fellow at the mccain institute foreign_policy tank based in washington mean no reset don he going to try anything like kramer in reference to obama failed reset policy kramer think biden have to focus largely on domestic issue thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and it economic impact and to the extent he is able to focus on foreign_policy should not be at the high end of the priority list he told voa although he added you cant ignore it and it is factor in number of problem we face he going to have to devote his limited when it come to foreign_policy to work with country that are ready to solve problem by that he mean shoring up america transatlantic alliance biden and putin have met without cordiality in interview with magazine biden at meeting he told the leader looking into your eye and don you have soul biden continued he looked back at me and he smiled and he we understand another aside the lack of personal rapport analyst any effort to reset relation would be complicated by economic sanction on imposed by both the obama and trump administration the measure leave biden with little room to maneuver and are unlikely to be lifted while western power believe is mounting cyberattacks against them former western diplomat antagonism is likely to persist between washington and moscow a a the kremlin seek to undermine western democratic institution last week former top security_adviser to british prime_minister boris johnson mark sedwill revealed that britain ha launched series of covert cyber based attack on leader and their interest to impose price greater than they might have expected for their cyber offensive against the west other allied power

hunter over his service on the board of an energy company in ukraine and business dealing with china but putin dodged an opportunity to amplify the allegation against hunter biden saying yes in ukraine he had or maybe still ha business it doesn concern u it concern the american and the ukrainian don see anything criminal about this the leader ha also sought to highlight possible common ground with biden especially over nuclear arm_control putin called this month for the last existing nuclear arm_control pact between and the to be saved proposing to extend the start treaty that set to expire in february it would be extremely sad if the treaty cease to exist he the treaty wa signed in by barack_obama and then president dmitry medvedev the pact limit each country to no more than deployed nuclear warhead and deployed missile and bomber during his career in the senate biden wa champion of nuclear arm_control and he ha promised to seek to extend the start treaty saying he would

best tackle global threat by leading alliance of democratic state he he would immediate step upon entering office to strengthen alliance and once more have america lead the world however biden be

the back burner analyst analyst have it could the biden administration several month to put together it entire foreign_policy team and set more specific priority biden ha he would seek to repair transatlantic tie which he asserts president donald_trump ha damaged by repeatedly criticizing the european union and nato slapping tariff on some european good and withdrawing international agreement in contrast to trump who in called nato obsolete biden ha called it the most effective political military alliance in modern history and it must remain strоng while adapting to kind of threat to counter aggression we must keep the alliance military capability sharp while also expanding it capacity to on nontraditional threat such a weaponized corruption disinformation and cybertheft he wrote

threat to the security of the united_state today he ha criticized the kremlin for action the seizure of crimea and for it role in the war between kyiv and backed separatist in ukraine donbas region he ha also accused it of interfering in election and of being behind attack on journalist and civil_society leader trump rarely criticized the kremlin unlike trump ll defend our democratic value and stand up to autocrat like putin biden in tweet in august he ha also threatened to punish moscow if it interfered in the election and rejected trump idea of inviting back into the group of seven

beneficial to security and should be extended while agreement is sought while bidens position on putin and russia action suggest that tension between washington and moscow remain tense and could potentially worsen once he take office arm_control is of handful of issue that analyst could present platform for productive negotiation between the united_state and the kremlin biden ha that he would have the united_state rejoin the nuclear agreement with iran which curbed the country nuclear activity in exchange for sanction relief if tehran move back into compliance with it term iran violated

very fertile ground in because we have mass distrust in our own election is democracy on paper but mr putin largely eliminated democratic freedom early in his year rule the country still hold election with the opposition candidate generally handpicked by the authority to provide facade of choice only in do they win but russian are interested in how democracy can work and how political battle really

ha been put in question the kremlin for some kind of clarity in the election result before commenting but the foreign ministry leapt at the opportunity to criticize the united_state with the same kind of language that some russian believe washington ha and wrongly lectured them with with the opponent for the post of president running approximately equal to each_other the obvious fault of the american electoral system become clear the foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova this is partially explained by the archaic legal code and it ambiguity on key matter a we have more than once but the image on television of poll worker across america diligently counting ballot may have told their own story about how democracy function critic of the kremlin have next to no ability to the television airwave so some tried to deploy social_medium to push back on the narrative of election fraud in america vladimir milov an adviser to mr navalny on facebook that the count of american mail in ballot could be trusted unlike in where remote voting is especially prone to falsification this isn where they hide ballot in safe at night that the election committee chairman ha key to mr milov

next to the thermometer and where he and his wife never set foot when they are in bad mood but the oak barrel marked in chalk muscat hamburg cahors hollow sound when you tap them the police showed up last summer at his winery in southern and drained them all hate them mr prokhorov referring to the authority slamming his left fist into his right palm hate them with fierce loathing on glance the rebirth of fine winemaking catering to off russian more refined taste is putin era success story but beyond the vine darker and very tale of big dream dashed hope bureaucratic nightmare and police raid come into view of smallest and most innovative winemaker with the informal approval of local official operated without license considering them prohibitively cumbersome and expensive then about year_ago the federal authority started cracking down bringing the easy boom year of the country upstart vintner to an end cover almost seven million square mile of territory most of it frozen year round and of the soil yielding little except cloudberry lingonberry and poking out of the thawing ground but then there is sliver the caucasus foothill to crimea where the softly undulating deep green land glowing beneath the warm autumn sun is reminiscent of tuscan afternoon the ancient greek made wine around here and so did the czar who brought in french expertise the soviet collectivized the vineyard and turned winemaking into industrial scale enterprise like that chateau of the proletariat in wine rich area like the resort city of anapa there were once dispensing chilled riesling by the

merlot and sauvignon blanc seemed very wary of journalist by way of explanation andrei greshnov former moscow banker pointed to his bottle there were no excise stamp typically required for alcohol sold in getting licensed for making and selling wine had been too costly for small scale producer like mr greshnov so he and dozen of others operated outside the law with wink and nod local official

this ha become impossible they ve been squeezed to put it bluntly law_enforcement official they are combating tax avoidance and counterfeit and unsanitary production which are indeed problem in recent change in the law are supposed to it easier for small winery to be legal but mr minasov calculates that winery still to produce at_least bottle year just to cover the expense at minimum of getting licensed and more problematically of keeping up with the ream of building regulation and reporting requirement he added that he belief small scale winery should not be required to be licensed at all but they don listen to u up above on hillside by the sea ivan karakezidi descendant of greek who go by yannis wa on the phone with yet another lawyer since the mr karakezidi ha been of the region best

fyodor lukyanov in general dont that we can expect really big difference vi vi kim thats fyodor lukyanov the editor of in global affair lukyanov conceptually of course the difference might be that biden administration can revitalize the agenda largely abandoned by donald_trump about freedom democracy and human_right worldwide kim at the same biden may have more leeway to start talking with the kremlin because no can accuse him of being putin puppet step may be the extension of the start arm_control treaty which expires couple of week after inauguration in january lukyanov for biden it good

influence our election in mainly involving misinformation with the primary goal of denigrating joe_biden and the u indictment of six military intelligence hacker last week served a reminder of the potential threat however a biden enters the final day of the campaign with significant lead putin appears to be hedging his bet the president pointedly declined to amplify donald_trump about biden son hunter and his past business dealing in ukraine noting he did not see anything criminal in them putin ha also pointed to possible common ground with the democrat on social democratic ideology and arm_control the leader and the former vice_president certainly each_other past encounter though the relationship lack any of the warmth that trump claim infuses his bond with the leader looking into your eye and don you have soul biden told putin at meeting according to an account he he looked back at me and he smiled and he we understand another biden ha not dwelled on the worn topic of trump soft spot for putin or kremlin meddling in because coronavirus ha cast such shadow over the election and the biden team feel that voter are tired of hearing about the most resonant issue for american voter right are trump mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic the economy and the danger of white nationalism by contrast election interference in seems more distant for those just trying to end meet michael carpenter foreign_policy adviser during biden a vice_president who remains in touch with the campaign it is possible too that russiagate wa never major vote winning issue trump supporter dismissed the charge a fake_news and of his opponent were more focused on other issue is medium and washington conversation my student don care about they care about black life matter and metoo nina khrushcheva american professor of international affair at the school in york question over the business dealing of biden son in ukraine have failed to resonate beyond trump core base with of biden alleged wrongdoing in ukraine largely falling flat if moscow did indeed their man ha done little to improve the the bilateral relationship over the past four year despite his personal praise for putin but and naked america self interest is something that the kremlin appreciates and may explain why official in moscow want to see trump win second term putin and people around him might like trump because he fit very nicely with their view of the world he graphic illustration of their logic that the world is moving away liberal value and multilateralism and towards sovereignty and traditional value andrey kortunov of the international affair council he that while putin genuinely doe not understand politician such a angela merkel or emmanuel macron and belief their talk of value to be hollow and cynical with trump there is recognition of kindred spirit if there is little affection for him a person the men share scepticism of international body emphasis on sovereignty approach to foreign_policy and feeling that discussion about value are mere hypocrisy kortunov putin earlier this month noted biden history of sharp anti rhetoric and contrasted it with trump oft stated desire for better tie with moscow biden approach to would involve supporting dialogue on arm_control strategic stability crisis management and risk reduction position of strength carpenter saying it wa simplistic to see the question of policy a black and white hawk or dove calculation kortunov that unlike germany israel or china is in the privileged position that the outcome of the election is likely to have little effect on bilateral_relation but the bad news is that this is because it be bad either way almost anything that could be broken is already broken he and there is little prospect of improvement kirill dmitriev the head of sovereign wealth fund who wa for informal contact with member of the trump entourage after his victory declined to whether he favoured trump or biden victory but he either way it wa hard to imagine how thing could get worse we are at the lowest point ever in the history of u relation so going lower would be difficult he still denies all accusation of meddling in the election whether it be the hacking of democratic party server or army of internet troll stirring up trouble on facebook and twitter but who wa the national_security council director for european and affair for three year of the trump administration and testified at trump impeachment hearing hawkish security official nikolai patrushev and other top official all but admitted interference in the vote when she confronted them the russian to u you guy left yourselves open they were admitting it essentially they it on you that this got so out of hand the official suggested that the u had left an open goal with it divisive politics and she felt they had point we were providing the raw material making our own mistake she the interference wouldn have resonated without our deep polarisation and our structural issue this round there are allegation of attempt to influence the political landscape such a apparently set up by russian and meant to influence u voter but there

advertisement_supported by hacker appeared to be preparing to sow chaos amid any uncertainty around election result official by and washington while senior trump administration official that iran ha been actively interfering in the presidential_election intelligence official they remained far more concerned about which in recent day ha hacked into state and local computer_network in breach that could allow moscow broader access to american voting infrastructure the discovery of the hack came a american intelligence agency infiltrating network themselves have pieced together detail of what they believe are plan to interfere in the presidential race in it final day or immediately after the election on nov official did not clear what planned to do but they it operation would be intended to help president trump potentially by exacerbating dispute around the result especially if the race is too close to call and homeland_security official also on thursday that state hacker had targeted dozen of state and local government and aviation network starting in september they stole data the computer server of at_least unidentified target and continued to crawl through some of the affected network the agency other official that the target included some voting related system and that they may have been collateral damage in the attack so far there is no evidence that the russian have changed any vote tally or voter_registration information official they added that the backed hacker had penetrated the computer_network without taking further action a they did in but american official expect that if the presidential race is not called on election night group could their knowledge of the local computer system to deface website release nonpublic information or similar step that could sow chaos and doubt about the integrity of the result according to official briefed on the intelligence such step could fuel mr trump unsubstantiated claim that the vote is rigged and that he can be defeated only if his opponent cheat some intelligence official view intention a more significant than the on wednesday night by the director of national intelligence john ratcliffe that iran ha been involved in the spread of faked threatening email which were made to appear a if they came the proud_boy right_wing extremist group the treasury department on thursday against iraj masjedi former general in iran revolutionary guard corp and the country ambassador to iraq the department general masjedi had overseen training of pro iranian militia group in iraq and directed group responsible for killing american force there official briefed on the intelligence that mr ratcliffe had accurately summarized the preliminary conclusion about iran but tehran hacker may have accomplished that mission simply by assembling public information and then routing the threatening email through estonia saudi arabia and other country to hide their track official compared the iranian action to playing single baseball while the russian are major leaguers nonetheless the iranian and the activity could pave the way for so called perception hack which are intended to leave the impression that foreign power have greater access to the voting system than they really do federal official have warned for month that small breach could be exaggerated to prompt inaccurate charge of widespread voter fraud official ability to change vote tally nationwide would be difficult given how disparate american election are the graver concern is the potential effect of any attack on few key precinct in battleground state hacker recently obtained access in couple limited case to election jurisdiction an election related network christopher krebs the director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency on thursday but he wa careful to note that the breach had nothing to do with the casting and counting of vote the hacker believed to be operating at the behest of federal security service the the successor agency to the soviet_era infiltrated dozen of state and local computer_network in recent week according to official and researcher but mr krebs the attack appeared to be opportunistic in nature scattershot break in of vulnerable system rather_than an attempt to zero in on key battleground state but official were alarmed by the combination of the target the timing the attack began le than month ago and the adversary which is known for burrowing inside the supply chain of critical infrastructure that may want to down in the future the official fear that could change delete or freeze voter_registration or pollbook data making it harder for voter to cast ballot invalidating mail in ballot or creating enough uncertainty to undermine result it reasonable to assume any attempt at the election system could be for the same purpose john hultquist the director of threat analysis at fireeye security firm that ha been tracking the group foray into state and local system this could be the reconnaissance for disruptive activity mr krebs so far wa not a active a iran and it targeting wa imprecise they broadly looking to scan for vulnerability and they working he current and former official there wa little doubt that remained greater threat and questioned why the focus wa on iran on wednesday night though they acknowledged that tehran interference wa real and troubling administration official the news conference reflected the urgency of the intelligence about iran but some saw politics at play mr ratcliffe focus on iran would potentially benefit mr trump politically it is concerning to me that the administration is willing to talk about what the iranian are doing supposedly to hurt trump than what the russian are likely doing to help him jeh johnson former secretary of homeland_security in the obama administration if the russian have in fact breached voter_registration data then the american people deserve to their government what it belief the russian are doing with that data senior official briefed on the intelligence american spy agency had been tracking the iranian group responsible for the spoofed email for some a result the government wa able to quickly debunk the falsified proud_boy email and identify iran a the culprit iran hacker appear to have scanned or penetrated some state and local network government official on thursday but security expert the proud_boy email campaign that the government attributed to iran did not appear to be based on hacked material and instead relied on publicly available information that florida official regularly distribute this wa an email sent nonexistent domain using publicly available information kevin brien the chief executive of greathorn cybersecurity firm there wa no hack here your name your party affiliation your address and email address are all generally speaking public information mr brien the information presented publicly that iran wa culpable speaker nancy pelosi also voiced skepticism of mr ratcliffe announcement is the villain here she before briefing intelligence official what we have seen in the public domain iran is bad actor but in no way equivalent so far the hacker have not focused on swing state where hack that affect digital could have maximum effect they have taken scattershot approach instead hitting system in multiple state some battleground expert they might be just testing to see where they could get in like thief trying every doorknob in the neighborhood my concern is not that they are pinpointing individual race but are gaining access where they can for some disruption down the road mr hultquist the threat is similar to the that official have highlighted ransomware attack which hold data hostage until victim pay to have access restored likewise official and researcher believe the attack would not necessarily change vote tally but could voter data inaccessible or delete or change voter_registration data to disenfranchise voter or cause the kind of confusion and delay that would undermine american confidence in the election in recent year homeland_security official have made concerted effort to secure voter_registration system and to ensure that election official have paper copy of voter information in case of disruption but they have further to go in gainesville ga this week ransomware attack held city system hostage an online map with polling location and the database used to verify voter signature on mail in ballot official and expert believe the greatest defense against coordinated cyberattack on the election is not so how secure these voting system are but how disparate you can just hit the election eric chien cybersecurity director at symantec of broadcom which wa among the to detail the stuxnet attack by the united_state and israel on iran nuclear program decade ago the soft target are really the state and local election committee local

more we have been through of casting away stone is to gather stone together senior federation official chechnya since shortly after the soviet_union collapse aim and policy in the south_caucasus have been constant but it capability to project power and influence have fluctuated engagement with the entire caucasus region is best characterized a tide it power and influence began to ebb at the start of the karabakh_conflict with the february massacre of armenian in the azerbaijani city of sumqayit being the key galvanizing event after that the tide receded rapidly leaving possession in the north caucasus without effective central control the chechen war marked low tide which only began to rise with the second chechen war beginning in until about wa too weak and internally divided to project power and influence in the wider caucasus region in meaningful way to be sure influence wa never gone completely during the lowest ebb of the tide still marshaled greater resource than the state of the caucasus could muster and it threw it weight around but in the did not have unified governing apparatus but rather mass of competing clan among which regional actor could maneuver for example after the soviet_collapse moscow left the military unit in the caucasus to their own device those unit served a mercenary arm supplier and logistics provider to both_side in the karabakh_conflict it took decade for moscow to reassert it so called power vertical in the caucasus symbolized by president_vladimir putin success in in finally ousting chief of the general staff anatoliy kvashnin assertiveness in the region grew steadily thereafter with sharp uptick after the war with georgia and putin return to the presidency in but while moscow ha gained the capacity to project more power and influence the regional landscape ha changed the surge in fighting over nagornyy_karabakh that began in late september ha demonstrated that is struggling to contend with vastly more complicated landscape more external actor are on the scene most notably turkey and all three south_caucasus state armenia azerbaijan and georgia have adapted their strategy to deal with the environment increased effort have had decidedly mixed result three factor were evident when the soviet_union collapsed and continue today narrowing policy option in the region armenia azerbaijan and georgia are all radically different with varying attitude toward and moscow rule throughout the imperial and soviet_era for century armenia ha sought protection against turkey and iran which ruled most of the armenian historic homeland this security concern wa paramount in the immediate aftermath of the soviet_collapse the soviet army had disappeared leaving the turkish third army a the most potent military force in the wider region for it post_soviet view armenia a it closest friend in the region large and influential armenian diaspora in ha maintained those positive feeling azerbaijani elite russified by the oil boom of the late nineteenth century have largely been friendly to thanks to former president heydar aliyev who rose through the rank of the soviet kgb and neither feared nor hated the post_soviet ruler of generally positive attitude toward survived the nationalism of the year immediately following the soviet_collapse though post_soviet wa initially suspicious of the expansion of turkish and western influence in azerbaijan ha since forged close energy relation with turkey in the early period these commercial relation took precedence in the turkey relationship more recently a detailed later in the paper the increasing ambiguity of turkish relation ha complicated relation with azerbaijan armenia and azerbaijan have incorporated friendly relation with into wider strategy former armenian foreign minister vartan oskanian described it a multivectoral approach in which foreign_policy vector point in different direction it entail seeking close relation with and assistance power other than primarily the united_state and the european union eu large armenian diaspora in the united_state and france have aided this endeavor in contrast poor record on democracy and

granted in in the wake of the september terrorist attack and azerbaijan subsequent role in assisting antiterrorism effort elsewhere in georgia nationalism remains centered on the rejection of since the massacre of unarmed civilian by soviet troop in the capital tbilisi in and the post independence presidency of former soviet dissident and extreme nationalist zviad gamsakhurdia georgian society ha generally come to view a usurping occupier february the the red army invaded tbilisi in is still observed annually a soviet occupation georgian explain away decade of fawning over the occupier a ambassador did for all those year that the russian ruled u we told them we loved them and they actually believed u georgian warlord deposed gamsakhurdia in january and installed former soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze a weak figurehead his tenure a president involved constant renegotiation of his power to gain ascendancy over those warlord in the early still at his weakest vi vi the warlord and pressured by support for abkhaz and ossetian separatism he tried to harness not reverse the extreme nationalism of his predecessor supporter especially those displaced abkhazia by backed separatist for their russian have acted a emotionally a the georgian seeing georgia aspiration toward the north atlantic treaty organization nato and the eu a the betrayal of it once advantageous position within moscow empire during regularly occurring period of heightened tension normally calm senior diplomat asked when the soviet_union wa ruled by people named jughashvili orjonikidze and beria just who wa occupying whom after the september attack a troop were arriving in georgia to train georgian in an embittered general recalling the old time of officer warm reception in georgia over countless song and wine filled banquet the american they teach the georgian to fight in reality the georgian teach the american to sing cannot deal with armenia azerbaijan and georgia in isolation because the country own relation with another are dense and fraught with tension and conflict most salient is the karabakh_conflict over which armenian and azerbaijani have shed so blood since both_side appeal to for support and view amity toward the other side a betrayal in the early year tried to profit the conflict clandestinely providing weaponry and mercenary to both_side in and russian backed coup to install puppet in azerbaijan but both backfired in former azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov attempt to return moscow wa thwarted by the nationalist azerbaijan popular front and in surat huseynov revolt against the popular front wa hijacked by aliyev who took power for himself alone thereafter stepped back in the region since brokering ceasefire in the karabakh_conflict in moscow ha limited it intervention to trying unsuccessfully to get the side to agree to led peacekeeping force of the sort moscow installed to control the abkhazia south_ossetia and transdniestria separatist conflict remains supplier of weaponry to both_side and every major arm sale to provokes protest the other because azerbaijan oil revenue expanded it ha been able to diversify it defense procurement but armenia remains dependent on for arm and security guarantee georgia is closely intertwined with both armenia and azerbaijan there are large armenian and azerbaijani minority in georgia in separatist abkhazia armenian actually outnumber the abkhaz despite initial nationalist difficulty in borchaly an azerbaijani inhabited section of georgia georgian azerbaijani relation have been good almost since georgia independence largely thanks to reconciliation of convenience between soviet_era rival eduard shevardnadze and heydar aliyev aliyev needed georgia to enable the western transit of azerbaijan hydrocarbon export and the import of western good turkey shevardnadze needed azerbaijan to secure oil and gas pipeline to provide both transit royalty and strategic importance to the west he also needed aliyev to help ensure that the large azerbaijani population of georgia reliably voted for shevardnadze political grouping the citizen union georgian armenian relation have been trickier portion of the armenian population in georgia is concentrated in javakheti near large soviet later military base that fueled the region economy until it wa closed in to the javakhk armenian sought independence apparently with encouragement but armenia only transit route to and the west lay through georgia a the karabakh_conflict had closed armenia border with turkey and azerbaijan so the government of then armenian president levon ter petrosyan tamped down javakhk separatism relation between the country grew closer after mikheil saakashvili came to the presidency in georgia in and they have remained friendly under subsequent leader to this policy in the south_caucasus is intertwined with the north caucasus to which ha devoted the blood and treasure of generation and which post_soviet see a key to the integrity of the state domestic security concern have intruded on the south_caucasus in number of area a power ebbed away at the end of the soviet_era the army for the in century no_longer wielded the decisive force in the region the turkish third army wa the most powerful military in the region and local adapted to the strategic effect threw it diminished resource into the caucasus to suppress the chechen rebellion and met defeat subsequent of the region and it demand to adapt the conventional armed force in europe treaty to allow for greater freedom of movement in the flank stemmed it perceived to redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence in the region to address move to adapt the treaty azerbaijan and georgia allied with moldova and ukraine to form what later solidified into the organization for democracy and economic development known simply a the guam ossetians ethno linguistically and religiously different their neighbor have been principal ally in the north caucasus for century a dealt with host of ethnic nationalism in the year after the soviet_collapse chechen separatism and later an armed islamist movement north ossetia gained strategic importance to and leverage with leadership it ha used that leverage to ensure robust support for south ossetian separatism georgia likewise other ethnic group in the mountain of the north caucasus for example the chechen kabardians and cherkes saw in abkhaz separatism georgia the validation of their own ethnic nationalism with facilitation so called volunteer made their way to abkhazia to join the separatist war against georgia to among the most effective of these wa the chechen shamil basayev who wa later an archnemesis of the russian but their ally in that struggle during the second chechen war fighter and their family took refuge in georgia pankisi gorge which wa effectively outside the georgian government control president boris yeltsin called shevardnadze in november to demand the reinstatement of border troop in georgia and passage for military unit through georgia to attack pankisi the south shevardnadze stalled and then called on the american to dissuade yeltsin later after the september terrorist attack the united_state sent troop to train the georgian to restore security in pankisi forestalling action there worse the point of view shevardnadze made deal with ruslan gelayev chechen commander sheltering in the pankisi gorge to launch an attack on abkhaz held territory in the attack failed but the authority viewed this series of event a proof that georgia wa treacherous and untrustworthy lastly azerbaijan share border and considerable ethnic overlap with dagestan autonomous republic where salafist proselytizing made extensive inroad in the after some year full fledged islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked up with the remains of the armed chechen nationalist movement which also fell under salafist influence when attack began on authority in dagestan security cooperation with azerbaijan gained importance for internal security the stage wa thus set early on for consistent static policy toward the south_caucasus an economy of force balancing act to preserve traditional friendship and strategic alliance with armenia without harming economic and security relationship with azerbaijan and constant emotional and ever deepening hostility toward georgia view the international arena a series of camp each centered by power whose greatness is confirmed by possessing camp ha been keen to ensure that the nation forged out of former soviet republic remain in it camp and ha formed multinational institution to cement those relation initially had hope that the commonwealth of independent state ci formed when the soviet_union broke up might fill the bill azerbaijan and armenia joined the ci at it inception in but it wa not until that georgia president shevardnadze under military pressure in support of abkhaz separatism and facing rebellion by ousted former president gamsakhurdia reluctantly acceded in georgia withdrew the ci after the country defeat in the russo georgian war with the ci having little influence put forward other institution to accomplish the task the collective security treaty originally signed in became the collective security treaty organization csto in designed a counterweight to nato armenia joined to relieve it security concern with regard to turkey azerbaijan and georgia did not the eurasian custom union officially formed in but active onward also included armenia but not azerbaijan or georgia in turned the custom union into the eurasian economic union eaeu intended a mirror image of the eu moscow ongoing attempt to equate the organization on the international stage ha had significant effect on the caucasus a noted later in this paper azerbaijan wa able to avoid joining so called camp thanks to it independent oil revenue which have grown for both azerbaijan and other post_soviet caspian littoral state in the early moscow ability to project power wa low and could only protest ineffectually when littoral country signed hydrocarbon extraction contract in the absence of an international agreement to define national right in the caspian azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan brought in western energy major without fearing reaction azerbaijan signed it major contract in the status of the caspian wa not codified preliminarily until and to this no treaty cover exploitation of the seabed could not fight em so it joined em settling for sharing in the profit hydrocarbon development and transit for in the mid the united_state and maneuvered against another through their respective support of pipeline the united_state heavily promoted the baku tbilisi ceyhan btc pipeline a an alternative to monopoly on hydrocarbon transit to the west however doctrine demanded that the pipeline be commercially viable in it own right and the united_state refused to put resource into boosting that viability recognizing this banked on the oil major desire to save money by transporting the oil by tanker across the black sea and through the turkish strait but when then bp chair john browne visited istanbul and inspected the narrow bosphorus passage he decided the route wa too risky and threw the weight of the oil major behind btc closest relationship in the south_caucasus remains with armenia the country most firmly entrenched in camp it is frequently called strategic alliance and for armenia this is certainly the case a troop based in it second largest city gyumri form trip wire against turkish military action while azerbaijan generally deal with other country transactionally another criterion take precedence their stance on armenia and the karabakh_conflict this is the trickiest situation for to manage azerbaijan is largest trading partner in the caucasus the country have important common issue regarding hydrocarbon and see strategic aim in keeping azerbaijan out of what it call the western camp therefore while supporting armenia ha tried to avoid alienating azerbaijan during the recent surge in fighting until wa discreet about it arm sale to armenia to avoid provoking azerbaijan denying report of large arm transfer when they surfaced in more recently ha started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry to both_side and ha been more open about it balancing for example in signed lease on it military base in gyumri extending it to and agreed to sell surface to air missile to azerbaijan a of this balancing is involved in attempt to mediate between azerbaijan and armenia to resolve the karabakh_conflict since ha been co chair of the minsk group body under the aegis of the organization for security and co operation in europe osce and composed of number of country interested in brokering peace in the united_state and france joined a co chair and the three country have conducted all negotiation thereafter without significant input the other group member this structure ha facilitated west cooperation to keep politically insoluble problem flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline state when dmitry medvedev wa president of he poured great effort into peace initiative and with french and assent came to dominate the process a of this campaign medvedev also supported the opening between armenia and turkey azerbaijan closest ally that rapprochement failed however due to opposition key constituency on both_side ultimately azerbaijan and armenia were not interested in negotiated solution and medvedev initiative foundered relation with georgia quickly went into downward spiral after the soviet_collapse used substantial military force to ensure the survival and then victory of the separatist rebellion in abkhazia and leveraged that and revolt by gamsakhurdia to force shevardnadze to accept peacekeeping force in western georgia still hostile backed attempt in and to assassinate shevardnadze until the latter attempt shevardnadze had been trying to play and the united_state off against each_other but these action drove shevardnadze squarely into the arm of the united_state the russian loathed shevardnadze for his role in the collapse of the soviet bloc on television program he wa reviled a the ostap bender of the soviet_union after the con man protagonist of the classic soviet comic novel but that feeling paled beside the emotion stoked in the leadership by the flamboyant and mercurial mikheil saakashvili who ousted shevardnadze at the end of and became president in in that year saakashvili also ousted the quasi independent aslan abashidze his rule over the autonomous batumi region which housed military base also in tension flared in south_ossetia retaliated over the next few year banning the import of georgian product banning flight between and georgia closing the land border between the country and launching an aggressive campaign against ethnic georgian in citizen their business and their family in closed off most of north ossetia to foreigner allowing preparation for war to proceed unseen by the outside world and in a tension flared again in south_ossetia troop invaded defeating georgia force in short order occupying part of georgia outside abkhazia and south_ossetia and incorporating these conquest into the separatist statelets which shortly thererafter recognized a independent but the war also brought the expansion of competitor presence the small neutral osce mission wa scrapped and large eu monitoring mission wa put in it place despite the limitation placed on that mission the overall eu presence and commitment sharply increased putin return to the presidency in came with more assertive foreign_policy leader wholly dependent on were installed in the separatist entity supported south_ossetia and abkhazia replacing established leader who were pro but possessed their own independent power base more importantly began to treat the european union not just nato a strategic rival intent on taking over part of what medvedev had called sphere of five year earlier that view had been restricted to the or senior officer of the hard power ministry primarily the military internal affair and security service after putin return to the presidency it became official policy the ukrainian crisis of began with putin pressuring both ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and armenian president serzh sargsyan into repudiating the eu association agreement they had signed and instead joining the nascent centric eaeu the pressure on sargsyan included putin visit to azerbaijan capital baku to discus arm sale yanukovych caving to putin pressure triggered the revolution of dignity in ukraine and his eventual downfall sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequence he explained to the nation that security concern necessitated joining the led organization that only could safeguard armenia it neighbor however after rejecting the eu sargsyan immediately tried to placate it negotiation eventually restarted on trade agreement and in armenia signed comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with the eu after few protest armenian fell in line with sargsyan capitulation to putin wish they assumed their security expectation would be met and that this change wa worth the economic disadvantage of giving up the association with the eu indeed when few month later occupied crimea and annexed it after the fig leaf of controlled referendum armenian saw this a model and justification for future annexation of nagornyy_karabakh and the surrounding territory action had called into question all territorial disposition after the soviet_collapse which had been agreed among the union republic codified in the ci treaty and endorsed by the international community with border questioned and more capable of projecting power it wa better to be close ally of than potential victim but in april armenian suffered rude awakening on april azerbaijan began military operation along the line of contact in karabakh and over the next four day managed to regain few strategic point occupied by the karabakh armenian year before reaction wa to maintain it balancing act foreign minister sergey lavrov went to the region explicitly to be neutral mediator he brought ceasefire plan and proposed the peacekeeping force that had been rejected so year earlier that approach did not go over with the armenian populace in their view armenia wa treaty ally of and had given up european aspiration to stay in camp and therefore should be on armenia side however a far a wa concerned legally the combat had nothing to do with armenia but wa between nagornyy_karabakh and azerbaijan the armenian people did not see it that way after being convinced by their leader over generation that karabakh and armenia had become single polity sargsyan who initially supported the idea of peacekeeping force wa seen a having sold out armenian interest he then had to backtrack putting fatal crack in his prestige and authority almost immediately mutiny and demonstration broke out occasionally with subtle anti flavor in july group of gunman calling themselves sasna tsrer daredevil of sassoun an armenian epic poem violently took over police station and held out against government force for week demanding sargsyan resignation after they surrendered they retained widespread support which translated into people fed up with the ruling elite and with other factor such a notorious murder by soldier price hike by the owned electricity supplier and continued arm sale to azerbaijan further exacerbated popular discontent in faced with term limit when his presidency wa to expire in sargsyan chose of the standard post_soviet autocratic solution to staying in power establishing parliamentary system turning the presidency into figurehead and becoming prime_minister sargsyan and his dashnak nationalist ally duly won parliamentary election in and figurehead president wa in due course elected in then the play went off script the aggrieved populace rose up in demonstration and in just over month sargsyan wa ousted opposition_leader nikol pashinyan wa installed a acting prime_minister and election affirmed his position later in the year so far this scenario resembles of the color revolution that putin had railed against for the previous fifteen year and had tried to reverse through military force in georgia syria and ukraine but instead of condemning pashinyan who had sharply criticized during the demonstration and lending full support to sargsyan of putin most loyal supporter putin wa remarkably restrained throughout and had friendly and supportive meeting with pashinyan just day after the latter took power publicly offering him his congratulation and best wish it is possible that blamed sargsyan for the anti sentiment following the clash of april but it is also clear that pashinyan made effort to reassure putin a he like the entire armenian electorate understood that remained the guarantor of armenia security vi vi it larger neighbor he also understood that any rift with would create vulnerability that azerbaijan could exploit with regard to karabakh pashinyan knew he could not afford any daylight between armenia and he left armenia in the eaeu and csto he made clear that he would pursue democratic system but he also that he viewed democracy a firm belief rather_than geopolitical orientation making clear the distinction perhaps the fact that putin knew this a implying no major change in armenia strategic orientation occasioned his restraint if there is no threat that armenia leave it camp can continue balancing it policy toward azerbaijan and armenia azerbaijan is the type of country with which putin seems to feel comfortable stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policy azerbaijan cause few headache for and demand only that it transactional approach be reciprocated president ilham aliyev began his rule only three year after putin took over his father heydar aliyev had ruled azerbaijan for decade before that not counting the soviet period when he also ruled the country a his own fiefdom heydar aliyev in the senior most rank of the soviet state communist_party and security service made his attitude very different other post_soviet ruler some of whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki in soviet time and saw moscow a the source of all power heydar aliyev treated post_soviet ruler without the fealty or fear that some of his contemporary showed ilham aliyev doe not have the experience or ability of his father but he ha inherited that legacy of autonomous sovereignty if pashinyan intends to show that democracy is belief not geopolitical choice the aliyevs have since shown that the same is true of autocracy azerbaijan and have enjoyed functional transactional relationship that is cordial neighborly and devoid of emotion to some extent azerbaijan grew ideologically closer to in the wake of the ukraine crisis a both country saw themselves a attacked and undermined by fifth column of western supported civil_society and nongovernmental organization in the chief of azerbaijan presidential apparatus usually considered closest to in the azerbaijani leadership published scathing article outlining that worldview he implied that charge of human_right violation against country only proved that it leadership wa defending it sovereignty but ideological sympathy never overcame azerbaijan transactional approach to relation with in azerbaijan demanded sharp increase in the rent wa paying for the soviet_era qabala radar station the station wa of the soviet and strategic early warning system and therefore the united_state favored it continued functioning to help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launch nonetheless azerbaijan stuck to it price demand and the russian eventually closed the station at the end of apart it transactional approach the azerbaijani leadership ha single prism for judging the action of all other country the karabakh_conflict since independence azerbaijan ha rejected virtually all form of multilateral cooperation involving armenia that ha imposed durable limit on the extent of rapprochement with for example azerbaijan ha not joined the csto of which armenia is member to do so it would have to renounce any military solution to the karabakh_conflict and it ha been tenet of faith in azerbaijan that only the credible threat of military solution can pressure armenia to negotiate seriously nor ha azerbaijan joined the eaeu a armenia did joining it could limit azerbaijan ability to it economic leverage to marshal international support on karabakh and counter armenian diaspora influence in the west particularly in the united_state and france indeed because annexation of crimea call into question the border of the former soviet republic which the republic recognize a state border under the alma ata declaration of december it also call into question the basis for azerbaijani claim to sovereignty over nagornyy_karabakh moreover for the last fifteen year proposed principle for negotiated peace in the karabakh_conflict have included binding expression of the popular a of the ultimate disposition of the territory the staged referendum in crimea drove home to the azerbaijani how easy it is for the power with boot on the ground to ensure it desired outcome in such vote all in all since azerbaijan ha become if anything more transactional in it approach to the offensive in karabakh which might earlier have been deterred by reluctance to antagonize can be seen a example the fighting azerbaijan initiated on september can also be seen a transaction with made possible by turkish intervention to be sure aim of the offensive is to regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chip armenia side of the board but perhaps the larger aim is to threaten putin with instability and possibly region wide war if he doe not force deep concession on armenia aliyev ignored lavrov initial offer the return of province in exchange for being allowed to deploy peacekeeping force whatever the outcome it is clear that to azerbaijan is le of partner and more of problem to be solved azerbaijan try to solve it problem through closer relation with in particular turkey and china turkey ha been azerbaijan main advocate in the international sphere aside ethnic kinship significant azeri population life in eastern turkey and deep historical link before the soviet takeover turkey is quick to cite certain protectorate right granted under the treaty of moscow and kars since independence azerbaijan ha seen turkey a counterweight to power at present however turkey ha it own complex relation with turkey enjoys the positive effect of continued close energy and pipeline relation a a personal interaction between putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan but offsetting these effect are sharp difference between turkey and on the conflict in syria and libya azerbaijan seek to ensure that turkey support vi vi is unwavering turkey support of azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement in the autumn fighting have granted azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver vi vi both on the battlefield and with regard to mediation effort it took the kremlin almost week to arrange putin aliyev phone call humanitarian truce brokered by lavrov fell apart almost immediately china ha increased it engagement with the caucasus a of it belt and road initiative though neither it trade nor investment in the region compare with it far more massive engagement in central asia it main partner in the region is azerbaijan which ha the largest population economy and reserve of natural resource the partnership make sense geopolitically a although china is major trading partner for armenia and georgia armenia is too dependent on to be pried loose and china is probably wary of sensitivity on georgia china ha become the third largest source of import for azerbaijan after and turkey azerbaijan present the most potential for future political rapprochement and china unlike the west is not burdened with concern over azerbaijan human_right record azerbaijan hope that a the belt and road initiative progress china increase it of azerbaijan for the transit of cargo to europe floating cargo across the caspian and loading it onto the railroad link opened in between baku and kars in turkey via georgia putin once famously declared that he would hang saakashvili by his testicle that promise remains unfulfilled but not for want of trying saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority in and wa voted out of office in if putin thought saakashvili ouster by the billionaire and until shortly before then citizen bidzina ivanishvili and his georgian dream party would liberate wellspring of affection for he wa in for disappointment the georgian populace remains deeply suspicious of in late nato initiated major assistance program the substantial nato georgia package sharply ramping up security cooperation with the georgian dream government hostile and aggressive policy toward georgia too remains unchanged a always the pressure point between and georgia ha been separatism namely the backed polity in abkhazia and south_ossetia in the run up to putin return to the presidency serving local official in area controlled by especially in the supported south_ossetia and abkhazia and transdniestria outside the region were ousted with moscow backing newcomer who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience to putin alone at the end of edmund kokoity who had ruled south_ossetia since wa forced to resign the leadership and wa ultimately replaced by leonid tibilov veteran of the kgb in abkhazia the death of sergei bagapsh in may triggered premature power struggle that threw the plan off track in the election that followed moscow chosen candidate raul khajimba wa defeated however with the intervention of putin fixer vladislav surkov president alexander ankvab wa ousted in june and khajimba wa installed by then had occupied and annexed crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprising in donbas a a kharkiv and odessa in response the west had imposed sanction perhaps this left putin and his regime le concerned with placating western opinion and he moved to annex the separatist in all but name a early a october the month after khajimba inauguration presented abkhazia with draft treaty of alliance integration and partnership whose main point were the takeover of key executive department of the abkhaz state by their homologues with at best nominal abkhazian security institution serving a fig leaf presented south_ossetia with draft comprising identical term at about the same though the public announcement came in november in the treaty that were eventually signed the abkhaz won face saving concession the russian it took four draft before the south ossetians signed but their version wa closer to the original the close informal relation between south_ossetia and north ossetia made the word on paper le important the stifling embrace of moscow and the suspected poisoning of khajimba electoral rival led to the ouster of khajimba in early and his replacement by aslan bzhania himself veteran of the kgb in south_ossetia anatoliy bibilov who had floated between the north and south ossetian military defeated tibilov action have continued to ensure that georgian resentment over the remains an open wound the process of borderization continues in south_ossetia border troop periodically erect border fence that enclose bit of land hitherto under georgian control in july border fence cut off of the strategic baku supsa oil pipeline the line that carried azerbaijani early oil to market in the west before the main baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline wa completed ha not interfered with the oil flow but the implied threat is clear for it it appears that georgia under saakashvili tried to return this threat by reopening link with chechen and islamist rebel group in the north caucasus a shevardnadze had done with the chechen commander gelayev in charged in and again in after murky incident in the lopota gorge between the pankisi gorge and dagestan that georgia wa arming and training chechen militant to fight inside in several year after saakashvili wa replaced by the le anti georgian dream party the chechen commander involved in the lopota incident wa killed by georgian security force in tbilisi thus cycle of perceived provocation followed by emotional reaction and retaliation continues today most recently mere choice of seating at meeting led to crisis between the country june to the assembly on orthodoxy met in the parliament in tbilisi with orthodox country in attendance this wa presumably intended a gesture at reconciliation between the orthodox majority of and georgia on june member of the state duma presided over the session and sat in the georgian parliament chair seat violent street protest immediately broke out in tbilisi disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation of georgia parliament chair the following amid continuing protest against in tbilisi putin ordered the cessation of direct flight between georgia and a he had in the run up to the war the incident highlight that symbol of power relation evoke both charged emotion and material retaliation and that the pattern of event be repeated for the foreseeable future it is hard not to conclude that putin personal overreach in ukraine ha led to suboptimal result for in the south_caucasus when he resumed the presidency of putin increased engagement with the south_caucasus perhaps hoping to gather some castaway stone closer into the camp by autumn everything seemed to be going his way armenia and ukraine had bowed to his demand to reject association agreement with the eu and to sign on instead with the eaeu that putin had singlehandedly created promoted and dominated relation with azerbaijan were on an keel without expenditure of effort and georgia despised saakashvili had been replaced by billionaire whose government wa floating trial balloon about normalizing relation with moscow despite recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south_ossetia but relation with all three south_caucasus country reverted to type after intervention in ukraine moscow stifling embrace of ruler such a sargsyan and khajimba led to popular discontent and their forcible ouster the precedent set on ukrainian territory led azerbaijan to proceed with extreme caution in it relation with and expansionist policy with regard to abkhazia and south_ossetia have guaranteed the hostility of the georgian populace and repudiation by what might have been friendlier government a observer have noted major outside power such a china turkey and the eu have capitalized on local suspicion of they have developed strong interest in all three south_caucasus country and have the wherewithal to defend those interest against maneuvering while also providing the local with greater room for maneuver turkey willingness to major military role in support of azerbaijan in the fighting that began september show that power no_longer ha the deterrent effect it once did against intervention by outside power interest themselves are not yet seriously threatened but expansion of those interest ha been blunted can then that policy in the south_caucasus and in the wider post_soviet space have forced it back on the stony path it had been

damage done to the reputation may year to repair this article is of fp round the clock coverage of the election result a they come in with short dispatch correspondent and analyst around the world the page is free for all reader moscow in the presidential_election ha become national obsession ordinary people who rely on state controlled television a their main source of information have seen the topic pop up every on multiple talk show among the elite the duel between president donald_trump and former vice_president joe_biden ha become the favorite topic of conversation at fancy restaurant and in the corridor of power the prevailing view is that victory for biden would be bad for because democratic administration is expected to impose economic sanction on moscow a punishment for it bad behavior and foremost for it interference in the presidential_election this view is widely shared by pro kremlin pundit senior official and the executive of state owned enterprise and is promoted by the few remaining independent medium outlet such a the newsletter daily staple in the information diet of the upper middle class more nuanced view on biden is held by some people working on issue in the government president who is not tainted by suspicion of being asset and who know how to organize normal process for national_security discussion be able to restore some guardrail to the relationship and prevent further deterioration those people argue president biden would not be able to pay close attention to since he and his senior adviser be overwhelmed by domestic issue and otherwise focusing on china but possible democratic administration appears to be open to retaining some pillar of the arm_control regime and discussing rule of competition in cyberspace and it could be more clear eyed and therefore skeptical about the side effect and efficiency of sanction a the united_state major tool in policy depend on who is put in senior position such a secretary of state and national_security advisor and on the midlevel bureaucrat controlling the portfolio after relation nearly hit rock bottom on trump watch nobody in belief that four more year of trump could be good for moscow if trump is reelected the only silver lining be the deeper level of disarray in the western alliance and disengagement it partner that second trump term would likely bring for the kremlin schadenfreude over the gradual demise of pax americana would simply sugarcoat the risk and downside of trump remaining in the white_house is senior_fellow at the carnegie moscow center twitter trending more foreign_policy despite some tough sanction and tougher criticism ha not topped america foreign_policy priority under president donald_trump who ha appeared to have congenial relationship with his counterpart vladimir_putin however that could all change if democrat nominee joe_biden win the november election according to expert who are weighing up the implication of biden presidency on relation at the very least analyst expect that victory for biden would increase tension between washington and moscow and would raise the probability of sanction on the country is already operating under international sanction on some key sector and official close to putin for action it annexation of crimea ukraine in interference in the election in and reported involvement in nerve agent attack in the in andrius tursa central and eastern europe advisor at teneo intelligence win for biden would improve transatlantic tie between the and europe and would see renewed commitment to nato that would be welcomed by europe however he also such result would mean mostly downside for citing recent history of mutual distrust and acrimonious relation between the kremlin and democrat in general potential biden presidency would be negative for moscow and likely lead to further deterioration of bilateral_relation both in term of rhetoric and substance the democratic party candidate ha maintained tough stance towards president_vladimir putin administration tursa in note friday the kremlin disdain for biden meanwhile date back to his vice presidency particularly his push for sanction against in response to the ukrainian crisis meaningful conflict resolution over crimea and in the donbas region in east ukraine where there are pro region that declared themselves republic still eludes moscow and kiev despite effort by germany and france to broker lasting settlement that both_side can live with tursa argued that without tangible process in region biden wa heavily involved in a vice_president moscow could hardly expect any meaningful easing of sanction and that potential biden presidency could lead to more stringent enforcement of existing measure the risk of sanction could also increase he any sanction on are unlikely to be imposed immediately however according to timothy ash senior emerging market strategist at bluebay asset management he on saturday that while do the course of relation remain on this deteriorating path am not sure that we should expect an immediate rollout of additional pent up sanction on those candidate likely to be running affair in biden presidency are all pretty experienced and level headed they won want to roll out sanction for sanction sake they want to be very proportionate and logical in approach he emphasizing that it important for the to have business like relationship with to ensure delivery on the strategic interest he the side under biden presidency would have to learn where they can tolerate each_other and get along on certain area of mutual_interest such a arm_control and reducing risk of conflict where strategic interest compete for example on area like ukraine belarus and turkey sanction be of the tool kit herein but only such tool is an area that both watcher believe could be point of mutual_interest and some harmony however biden ha signaled a saying in that he would want to see an extension of the major nuclear arm reduction treaty known a the strategic arm reduction treaty or the implementation something similar based on recent statement both_side negotiation on strategic arm reduction treaty start is area where progress could be expected if biden is elected teneo tursa however the timeline would be extremely challenging a the current treaty expires on february itself ha acknowledged that arm_control could be positive dynamic under biden presidency earlier in october putin criticized what he called sharp anti rhetoric biden but also that he had been encouraged by

comment on prevention and treatment of the disease and doe not affect doctor capacity to comment on various aspect of their work problematic one however given the retaliation against medical personnel who offered critical comment it reasonable to believe this instruction is intended to have chilling effect authority should stop trying to suppress information about covid this can have terrible

korean hacking team and identify the tool they were using to break into computer_network cyber_command wa expanding on push begun in when it to north macedonia montenegro and other country to learn more about operation the move also reflects stepped up effort to secure this year presidential_election cyber_command which run the military offensive and defensive operation in the online world wa largely on the sideline in but for the midterm election the command took far more aggressive posture in addition to sending the team to allied country it to would be troll before the vote in it offensive operation against moscow it then on election and the day afterward the operation wa focused mostly on according to what is publicly known about it but before the election this year intelligence official have described effort by iran and china a a to potentially influence the vote and cyber_command ha also widened it focus since we have expanded our hunt forward operation to all major adversary lt gen charles moore jr the deputy head of cyber_command in an interview in his office at fort meade cyber_command call it work with ally to find enemy hacker hunt forward operation after getting close to foreign adversary own network cyber_command can then get inside to identify and potentially neutralize attack on the united_state according to current and former official we want to find the bad guy in red space in their own operating environment general moore we want to down the archer rather_than dodge the arrow official would identify only region and not the country they had operated in before the election but cyber_command official those effort uncovered malware being used by adversarial hacking team other government agency used that information to help state

best way to be on offense to protect american interest m payton whose book manipulated examined emerging type of cyberattacks some lawmaker and expert believe that foreign influence effort could increase should there be disputed election result amplifying claim of fraud or demand for recount similarly cyber_command official their effort to try to counter foreign threat would not end with the

week and group of company led by microsoft have engaged in an aggressive campaign against suspected network that they feared could hold election system hostage come november then on monday that hacked the election for hacking the french election cutting power to ukraine and sabotaging the opening ceremony at the olympics and in silicon valley tech giant facebook twitter and google have been sending out statement every few day advertising how foreign influence operation they have blocked all while banning form of disinformation in way they never imagined year_ago it is all intended to send clear message that whatever is up to in the last week before election it is no hoax the goal both federal official and corporate executive is to disrupt honed information warfare system whether they are poised to hack election system amplify america political fissure or get inside the mind of voter but behind the scene is careful dance by member of the trump administration to counter the president own disinformation campaign that say the outcome on nov be rigged unless he win so while president trump continues to dismiss the idea of intervention combination of administration and industry official are pushing different narrative that intelligence agency facebook twitter google and others are avoiding the mistake of four year_ago when they all had their radar off but there is also no

in washington how far do we have to go is this far enough we are still scoping that out no be able to ass the effectiveness of the until after election when washington circulates the cyberequivalent of battle damage report but there are reason to question whether the effort to on some of which began in the midterm election have been too timid it is hardly coincidence that the indictment announced on monday against hacker with were unsealed day before the election but it is unclear what deterrent effect indictment can have when the officer are unlikely to ever see the inside of an american courtroom of the hacker named in the indictment wa previously charged with hacking election administrator four year_ago that did not stop him brazen hacking on the country of georgia last year likewise after wa outed for hacking the pyeongchang olympics that apparently did nothing to dissuade it british official revealed monday john carlin the former assistant attorney general for national_security who developed of the justice department strategy for indicting foreign hacker and later wrote about it in the book dawn of the code war mr trump denial of what happened four year_ago gave lot of leeway the detail in the indictment are stunning and reveal operative at the direction of the state attacking the whole world he adding that the conspicuous absence of leadership president trump on the issue wa all the more striking given the effort to expose and disrupt this activity these attack on country and civilian behavior won stop until the commander in chief call it out and work with the rest of the victimized world to deter future indiscriminate attack mr carlin if the indictment are the public face of the offensive against the russian the effort to dismantle trickbot vast network of infected computer used by ransomware group is the more covert element late last month the military cyber_command started neutralizing trickbot with series of attack microsoft digital crime unit secured federal court order to shut_down trickbot infrastructure around the world on tuesday microsoft the operation had been largely successful it ha taken down over percent of trickbot command and control server the idea is to keep the russian on the run so distracted that they are unable to those system for ransomware attack that could hold the election hostage these guy are really good and really move fast and we knew they would react to rebuild their system tom burt the microsoft executive who is running the team we were prepared to follow them and tear down whatever they build up but a cyber_command and microsoft were taking aim at trickbot hacking threat emerged over the past month different group of hacker known a energetic bear or dragonfly and believed to be operating within the country federal security service or the successor to the soviet_era ha been targeting american state and local network according to government and private security researcher their goal is still unclear but the timing so close to the election and the actor which wa have sent alarm bell ringing at cyber_command and at security firm like fireeye cyberscoop of leaked fireeye report on the campaign on monday official worry that if those hackings do not amount to the russian very presence inside state and local system could be used to support the president baseless

started censoring that content this month and stepping up it crackdown of qanon which promotes conspiracy that the world is run by satan worshiping pedophile plotting against mr trump the question is whether these effort so late in the election cycle have the intended effect since the president ha already primed his supporter and others to distrust the fake_news the deep state and the election

would moscow really help beijing in that way ha the knowledge but china ha the money would moscow help beijing for the right price it appears that china is relying on how and experience to develop the reactor for it nuclear aircraft carrier a the report china appears to be studying the nuclear reactor on largest icebreaker an approach that the soviet_union also took when it planned to build nuclear carrier in the specifically ha invited china to bid on the construction of class of nuclear icebreaker necessarily requiring the development of surface ship based reactor this approach stand in contrast to how the united_state and france developed nuclear reactor for their largest carrier but probably represents the best choice for china at this point to appreciate what at stake in china pursuit of nuclear powered surface warship it important to review the experience of the united_state and the ussr after the successful development of the us and the class nuclear attack submarine a a the merchant ship n provided proof of concept regarding nuclear propulsion the usn began to evaluate nuclear power for surface warship the usn nuclear surface warship wa the cruiser us commissioned in wa powered by w reactor generating around mw enough power to produce speed of knot for the ton cruiser hull the usn rapidly followed up with us enterprise powered by reactor each quite similar in construction and output to the those reactor generated mw each translating to shp driving the ton at up to knot few other nuclear cruiser and destroyer followed but the advantage of nuclear power in surface warfare ship wa limited by cost aircraft carrier were different story the class which began to enter service in reactor each rated at mw the recently commissioned us carry reactor capable of generating mw the extra power generation capacity of the ha little to do with speed rather the power provides surplus usable for variety of different system emals and highly sophisticated sensor down the road the extra energy may power point defense laser and similar equipment overall the reactor open up space to modernize and modify the vessel keeping them effective for their decade of project life the soviet experience wa somewhat different while the soviet enjoyed considerable success in developing nuclear reactor for submarine they approached the question of surface warship more carefully the nuclear powered soviet ship wa the icebreaker commissioned in with three ok reactor mw each between and the soviet would commission nine more nuclear icebreaker of the and class generally displacing between and ton and carrying ok reactor capable of mw these ship provided valuable experience but the soviet were slow to the leap to nuclear powered surface combatant in because soviet warship were expected to operate closer to home than their counterpart in however the soviet began building the of four ship of the class ton battlecruisers with both nuclear and conventional propulsion report differ on the power capacity of the kn reactor with range mw to mw these reactor would also have powered the class supercarriers class of ship that wa canceled upon the collapse of the ussr the chinese are undoubtedly thinking along line similar to those of the late soviet be conventional catobar carrier suggest ship roughly the size and sophistication of the which of course would require immense power generation capability like the united_state china want excess power generation in order to field suite of future weapon and sensor for this purpose china need reactor more powerful than those that it currently us on it submarine and building icebreaker for may provide the necessary experience this approach stand in contrast to that of the french navy which decided to upscale based on experience building nuclear reactor for submarine while france ha enjoyed success with nuclear sub the is widely believed to be underpowered relative to other fleet carrier us areva reactor the same type a employed on french submarine these reactor provide mw each but only drive the ton carrier some knot it worth noting that india considered but wisely rejected the idea of building in vishal a nuclear carrier largely because of the technical challenge of developing powerful enough reactor the idea of using technical data and nuclear how certainly make sense the perspective of the people liberation army navy the plan doesn have the luxury of the incremental approach adopted by the united_state and ha good reason to find the french approach insufficient to it need that the russian seem okay with letting the chinese study their icebreaker suggests once again that moscow and beijing currently see cooperation a in their term interest of course nothing be certain until china nuclear carrier actually enters service perhaps sometime around copyright all right_reserved updated_gmt hkt_october it is willing to agree to freeze it nuclear arsenal in order to

yandex the internet and search company the online bank tinkoff while the banking giant sberbank unveiled suite of technology product just day later a the reported analyst also point out that is overdue digitization surge and there could easily be room for both to emerge winner but behind this is another conflict the kremlin ever expanding attempt to bring technology firm in under the state control both company have played role in these effort yandex ha been under kremlin to give the government more influence over it decision and sberbank is state owned enterprise the latter is by the government corporate takeover such a yandex acquisition of tinkoff are pushing major tech_company into ever growing conglomerate controlled either directly by the government or by other actor trusted to advance kremlin internet policy but the kremlin toolkit of coercion is broader and more international than this tactic the government ha recognized the scale of political and economic power wielded by internet company and sought to channel that power toward it own end since war against ukraine the government ha carried out rapidly escalating crackdown on internet freedom but the hostile attitude toward freedom of information underlying internet policy ha changed little since vladimir_putin took office in the kremlin strategy for the internet ha in way mirrored the approach used early in the putin era to bring major broadcast and print medium then the major mean of information dissemination under effective government control at that the internet played no meaningful role in how most of the public read the news or communicated with another and therefore escaped major attempt at government interference in the year since however a the importance of dramatically in a in most of the world controlling the internet ha become higher priority for government willing to ever more authoritarian tactic in addition to it effort to control online medium outlet the government in recognition of the internet power a tool for communication ha prioritized maximizing it surveillance potential and enlisted social_medium and other tech_company in this push through publicly enacted measure it ha created legal and technological framework for the internet in under which only encryption rather_than any legal protection can effectively prevent the authority viewing the content of any internet traffic within the country third goal which receives surprisingly little attention relative to it potential significance is to enlist internet company in the government foreign espionage effort this topic may be downplayed due to justified cynicism it would of course be naive to assume that the government is alone in such conduct a authoritarian and democratic government alike regularly demand user information most often calling it necessary for the criminal justice process but ha had unique case made public in april pavel durov the founder of vkontakte known a vk most popular social_medium platform he received the previous december the country federal security service fsb which is responsible for domestic security but also foreign electronic surveillance the letter demanded the personal data of user running popular vk group involved in the ukrainian euromaidan protest movement that would ultimately result in the ouster of ukrainian president viktor yanukovych the fsb demand demonstrate the power of the government to requisition user data privately owned social_medium company expressly in order to conduct espionage abroad what set this apart the surveillance practice of most democratic government the united_state is the lack of any political or legal check that could serve to protect user privacy when edward snowden disclosure of the prism program revealed that intelligence wa collecting data social_medium platform such surveillance became major story in politics tech_company on their user behalf changed their practice to better protect user data government collection and to challenge it surveillance practice earning praise the american civil liberty union and other privacy activist in where the putin regime had already destroyed judicial independence asserted control of most medium outlet and seriously weakened civil_society durov revelation had little impact on public discourse around surveillance and the tech sector already by that point largely under kremlin control produced no comparable response vk story is illustrative of of the different tactic broadly employed by the government in it effort to gain control when durov published his letter the fsb four month after receiving it he had already fled that final conflict wa only the latest in between durov and the government that included an incident when durov refused prosecutor order to down vk page being used to organize protest against fraudulent parliamentary election provoking police special force raid on his apartment raid by masked and armed police on the office of tech_company and the home of their owner are a they are to some extent in all profitable part of the economy these extortion tactic are often paired with corporate ownership maneuver aimed at bringing those company under the ownership of state controlled company or kremlin friendly businessmen in the case of vk the personal pressure against durov occurred against backdrop of tech giant owned by the billionaire and close putin ally alisher usmanov to acquire controlling stake in vk when mail ru few month after durov fled the company added most popular social network to product portfolio that already included it namesake email service the most used webmail provider in and odnoklassniki the country second most popular social network corporate consolidation in the tech sector pose problem for freedom of expression and information everywhere in however the primary driving force behind such consolidation is not the company own economic motivation but rather the government political aim in the case of mail ru these platform were under the control of an owner ready and willing to his immense wealth and power to and to that merger however wa not the end of the kremlin of corporate takeover a an instrument to control the country tech giant yandex which in addition to operating most used search engine maintains news aggregator that is the single most popular news source on the internet and therefore ha similarly been to but yandex did not directly result these tactic instead the most proximate cause wa the threat of legislation that would limit or prohibit foreign ownership of tech_company in this case the relevant legislation wa directly intended to pressure yandex into corporate restructuring evidenced by the fact that the legislation wa introduced in during sberbank takeover attempt and then withdrawn after yandex voluntarily restructured other legislation however ha constrained the activity of company in number of way going beyond ownership the government surveillance system known by the acronym sorm ha infrastructure since the with update implemented to capture more internet and mobile phone communication a technology evolved company have little ability to push back a sorm give the fsb the capability and the legal right to collect data private company without those company knowledge law allowing internet oversight agency roskomnadzor to order the blocking of website supposedly engaged in criminal activity to censor political speech leaving publisher and user of blocked site no legal recourse most recently the yarovaya and sovereign internet law which entered into force in and respectively have and undermined any remaining legal or technical capacity that they might have to protect user privacy surveillance or supply user with uncensored information outside the country all of this lead to grim conclusion barring dramatic political reform the tech business sector can no_longer be source of independent action on behalf of free internet in and russian seeking to the internet for private communication and uncensored information have to turn elsewhere the outlook for international company while certainly more optimistic is also le clear moscow goal when it come to international technology company those incorporated in other country but operating in are quite similar to those it pursues with domestic firm authority want to maximize surveillance potential disrupt any possibility of domestic political unrest a result of those company content or service and continue projecting disinformation through the internet recent battle over data localization or the mandated storage of certain kind of data within border exemplify the kremlin desire to maximize it own surveillance potential through foreign company like authoritarian government that viewed the internet free information flow a threat to regime security moscow in that company with data on citizen store it locally firm could maintain copy of the data elsewhere but the data itself had to sit in server within the broad legal and political jurisdiction of the security service described above in recent year company like facebook and twitter have seemingly just these order and continued paying the trivial court ordered but pressure are likely to grow a putin further move to cement state control over data storage fit into broader picture of government effort to centralize internet data flow designed at the internet inception to prioritize fast and reliable delivery above all else to enable more effective government management and surveillance though the process is often purely technical the objective are fundamentally political in practice these measure allow the government to surveil dissident ensure the privacy of citizen data against perceived malicious foreign access and extend state information control in the digital domain simultaneously justifying of the kremlin other main goal in this sphere disrupting the potential for political pluralism enabled by foreign tech platform and projecting the state own disinformation through those same vector requires kind of argumentative gymnastics the government ha for year required foreign internet company operating in to remove content it deems false should company not comply the kremlin ha vested power in roskomnadzor to initiate technical block on those website although these block are often evaded or poorly implemented the government ha still managed to pressure foreign company to related to the covid crisis this minimizes the presence of state critical or contradictory information online in at the same government propaganda outlet often have large presence in major western platform like twitter and youtube and official anytime those firm action against state controlled news outlet these inherent contradiction in the government approach to international tech_company the kremlin want these company to operate in but only on the kremlin own term it pressure company to suppress free speech inside but howl when government messaging abroad is met with wariness mean that there is still space for international company to effect certain extent of internet freedom for citizen this operating space however is under constant threat the government and is likely to be the site of several major conflict in coming year international firm may continue to push back against certain element of state internet control firm that have mostly resisted complying with data localization rule have not indicated any changed willingness to follow kremlin pressure though resistance of this kind won apply to every area online it important to not group different component of internet control here content takedown for example are domain of internet control in the covid pandemic where the government wa quite successful in getting social_medium company to their platform within that official deemed false second the struggle to maintain free internet in increasingly be defined by technical dimension the government in june decided to on telegram the encrypted messaging app essentially it lacked the technical capacity to block it ironically this comprises certain kind of payback for none other than pavel durov telegram creator who since losing vk and fleeing ha built his messaging app into of the world most popular the sovereign internet law that came into force in for developing pernicious technical censorship capability perhaps most ominously the ability to selectively censor content on international social_medium platform in while maintaining plausible deniability it also required domestic internet company to centralize their architecture so authority could potentially cut off the internet the rest of the world in the event of security incident broadly defined thus it be incumbent on supporter of internet freedom to continue developing anti censorship technology and maintain the kind of technical edge that ha allowed telegram to continue operating in without compromising on surveillance or censorship full disclosure of the author of this article work for company that develops anti censorship software and with moscow advancing internet control domestically official continue seeking the normalization of this practice on the global stage recently these effort have focused on the united nation where the state ha proposed alternative cybercrime treaty that seek to justify it repressive internet policy and practice clashing with free and open internet norm upheld by democracy worldwide in december for the of these proposal an indicator of broader support among government for tighter internet control this wa not an accidental occurrence instead it spotlight to spread their authoritarian worldview and undermine global free and open internet model amid democratic uncertainty on the future of the internet these outcome should also serve a reminder to tech_company policymakers and anyone who care about maintaining an open global internet that internet freedom is neither inevitable nor permanent domestic internet sector once model of pluralism and independent thought ha been thoroughly subverted to the end of the government a once global internet splinter into it concerted opposition effort to maintain international norm affirming that the internet should be tool supporting

suddenly this young girl arrived and she drive me almost threw my arm around her neck in happiness she told dw in phone interview the thing is in comparison to the wave of coronavirus the second isn wave it more of tsunami kolchina estimate that the number of patient requiring care at home ha doubled in that is because covid case and suspected case are receiving treatment and testing at home in krasnoyarsk city of just over million people doctor hospital often dont have enough vehicle to cover the huge number of house call they are doing so without help the volunteer driver the doctor would have to walk to reach their patient in full protective gear and in temperature that have fallen below zero some of the most active volunteer met in person for the this week before busy of driving

headline the ministry of health last week banned medical personnel publicly commenting on the coronavirus situation without official permission local krasnoyarsk journalist sergei grigoriev and maria bukhtueva came up with the idea of connecting doctor to volunteer driver journalist maria bukhtueva of the creator of the krasnoyarsk chat connecting driver with doctor say the fear among medic is palpable lot of people here have had to choice the doctor should they accept the help being offered in the chat and by doing so admit that something is wrong with the system or should they stay silent and pretend that everything is alright she comment over the phone the volunteer driver are also battling their own fear and taking personal risk if the doctor provide them with after all doctor who arent in delegated coronavirus team are coming in contact with suspected covid case people desire to help ha become basic bukhtueva say there is sense that there is almost war going on war with the coronavirus doctor donish azizmurodov told dw that after getting help the driver he plan to volunteer in his free the volunteer agree all of them admit they are afraid of getting sick you can get infected anywhere at the supermarket on public transportation outside wherever so being scared is pointless say roman year old engineer viktor alekseev another driver say we all perfectly that we can get sick but knowing that you are healthy for and can help lot of people instead of sitting at home and waiting for disaster to come knocking that force you to get your act together every of the

they must reckon with the real world consequence of this virtual world consider the case of sergei furgal who unexpectedly won the gubernatorial election in the far eastern city of khabarovsk though he had no connection to the ruling party united in the ensuing year the kremlin sought to neutralize this political upstart by charging him for several murder committed in to the authority surprise furgal arrest triggered mass demonstration in khabarovsk and other city while the protest received only limited coverage on state tv channel news about them spread like wildfire across social network and youtube where live broadcast are targeted to hipper younger audience but unlike in the soviet_era when the hack on the screen could not hear you those read the comment and are responsive to viewer

translates into million of ruble advertising moreover the popularity of independent medium on youtube explodes the myth that russian do not care about politics youtube figure have quickly adapted in order to reach wider audience for example yuri dud former sport journalist ha cultivated large intellectually curious passionate following initially featuring interview with and talk show host he ha

million of view equally important dud audience is dominated not by the urban liberal intelligentsia but by schoolchildren and student dud know how to engage young people online and he ha been telling supposedly apolitical under what is really happening in their country finally among the greatest success story associated with the medium is main opposition_leader whom state tv did not mention by name until very recently in august navalny wa with the nerve agent novichok and then airlifted to berlin for treatment whereupon state medium finally started acknowledging his existence referring to him a the berlin patient hooligan on the internet and just blogger navalny of course ha been banned state tv but that is no_longer problem he recently granted dud an interview berlin and that received more than million view within day of being released there is no_longer any doubt that youtube ha become main platform for political journalism and unlike on state tv it leading voice cannot get away

relaunch production of the cold_war era missile carrier since no photo of the engined bomber have so far been released it not yet possible to determine the identity of the particular blackjack or whether all four of the turbofan are already installed the united aircraft corporation which ha manufacturing responsibility for the blackjack announced that the deeply modernized tu had performed it flight with it serial production nk engine at the kazan aircraft production association airfield in southwest on november the flight lasted hour and minute and saw the bomber climb to height of over foot with the crew led by test pilot anri naskidyants state owned news agency reported that the flight went smoothly adding that the aircraft wa equipped with flight and navigation equipment an onboard communication system modernized control system radar and lack of engine had been serious hurdle in moscow ambitious plan to restart production of the blackjack which had originally come to halt in after just example three of them non flying static test airframe had been completed with the collapse of the soviet_union of the tu left in ukrainian territory were scrapped another four of the bomber were left unfinished on the assembly line and of these were eventually completed in and today the aerospace force fleet is thought to include around blackjack which have performed number of high profile in recent year a a regular patrol flight then in april minister of defense sergey shoygu announced that production of the tu wa to be resumed ahead of this the company in southwestern city of samara received contract to restart production of the blackjack nk turbofan producing an improved nk version the of these engine wa planned to be ready for test in and some observer have expected that the same powerplant to be used in still secretive and still unseen pak_da generation bomber a a powering build blackjack the nk is required to keep tu the original production run operational of the tu the original production run over the river volga during mission it home base at engels in the saratov region the kuznetsov nk a installed in the original tu is widely reported a the most powerful combat aircraft engine in the world developing over pound of thrust at full afterburner while the nk is considered engine it actually date back to the mid when the soviet_union canceled it production on cost ground the improvement over the initial design included blade for the compressor and turbine plus more efficient cooling the nk is understood to have the same output a the original powerplant but offer increased efficiency extending the bomber range by around kilometer or just over mile according to medium report tupolev ha in the past claimed percent overall range increase the program to get the blackjack back into production ha been protracted perhaps not altogether surprisingly a the effort to reinstate production line and setup required tooling after decade of inactivity is considerable in january the ministry of defense signed contract for the next build blackjack which cost around million per copy plan called for example for the aerospace force to be rolled out in according to this schedule is still on track in the past the aerospace force have declared requirement for build tu aircraft of the aerospace force original batch of tu undergoes overhaul in kazan in in parallel with the production blackjack ha been busy with mid life upgrade program for it existing tu mission system and avionics originally the existing bomber were to be designated tu after completing their upgrade while the build aircraft would be designated tu this ha been rationalized and both variant are known a tu m therefore the aircraft to be engined with the nk turbofan is not build blackjack but either an example the earlier production batch that ha been brought up to tu status or prototype for the build aircraft constructed using of the incomplete airframe the original production run of these unfinished aircraft ha been completed a tu perhaps to serve a proof of concept for the build bomber this aircraft wa and began flight trial in january it is named after the former air_force chief the most recent blackjack to be completed is which ha been finished to tu standard meanwhile deeply modernized tu based on an aircraft the original production series named performed it maiden flight at kazan in february the aircraft wa originally built in february and wa of eight blackjack purchased by ukraine in after the fleet had been left there following the dissolution of the soviet_union the full tu configuration includes novella radar a a self defense suite and electronic surveillance system the flight deck is equipped with glass cockpit and the revised avionics encompass the communication suite flight control system and navigation suite alongside the deeply modernized tu ha also been performing le extensive upgrade on it blackjack fleet at rate of or aircraft per year this is the so called small modernization or tu and provides digital upgrade for the aircraft inertial navigation and engine control system a a armament deputy_prime minister yuri borisov ha the aerospace force continue to operate modernized tu m both upgraded and build example until the or the considering the blackjack can deploy conventional weapon a a nuclear one and have been in the syrian campaign it unsurprising that want to get the most out of it supersonic strategic bomber on the other hand the continued focus on the blackjack the tricky task of bringing it back into production should be seen against the prospect for the future pak_da which stand for perspektivnyi aviatsionnyi kompleks dalney aviatsii or future air complex of range aviation the research and development program for the pak_da began around the order to resume tu production that suggests that difficulty faced by the pak_da program led to the bomber program priority being reduced in favor of the tried and tested blackjack to this there ha been no official concept art of the pak_da so we really have no idea what the design look like however most observer expect that it be subsonic flying wing design possibly with low observable stealthy feature tupolev concept for the pak_da wa apparently approved in after which the united aircraft corporation received follow on contract for detailed design work and other contract to develop the aircraft system the then commander of range aviation branch anatoly zhikharev in late that pak_da prototype would fly in in however the idea of resuming series production of the tu appeared and with this the urgency assigned to the pak_da seems to have diminished indeed speaking in deputy_prime minister borisov described that relaunching production of the blackjack wa le risky path than the pak_da at the same we have postponed the pak_da to gain experience and restore technology he added borisov predecessor dmitry rogozin had the same year that the pak_da would perform it flight in or the prospect of the pak_da taking to the air in that kind of timeframe seem remote especially a the focus is on the tu continued upgrade and production restart which consume both funding and production capacity at the kazan plant meanwhile similar upgrade program for the and strategic bomber further reduce the urgency of getting the pak_da into service there is also the enormous cost involved in getting sophisticated clean sheet design into production and service in meaningful number moscow planned purchase of generation_fighter currently stand at just and other expensive weapon program have been while the pak_da look like it have to wait in the wing sometime longer the tu at_least provide the aerospace

white_house it seemed like the nightmare of all over again on october le than week before election u intelligence and law_enforcement official convened last minute to warn that foreign adversary were once again interfering in american democracy iran wa spreading false tale about allegedly fraudulent ballot and sending spoofed email purporting to contain threat the proud_boy designed to intimidate voter incite social unrest and damage president trump john ratcliffe the director of national intelligence meanwhile both and iran had obtained access to voter information that could be used to cause confusion sow chaos and undermine your confidence in american democracy he warned it wa everything that democrat and disinformation expert have been warning about for the last four year except not quite the email operation had been relatively small and immediately debunked while voter roll information is either public or easy to obtain senior intelligence official quickly raised doubt about ratcliffe emphasis on the threat iran over and questioned whether his motif for the public announcement were political the reported it wa very difficult to see those men in suit talking about interference in the election when the white_house is the interfering with the election claire wardle the executive director of draft group that research and combat disinformation after all when it come to intimidating voter or inciting social unrest nothing ha had more impact than the constant drumbeat of lie and disinformation year of preparation by the press social_medium platform and civil_society group for foreign interference campaign against the u electoral process have been upended by the bizarre reality that the biggest threat to american democracy right is almost certainly the commander in chief and that his primary mode of attack is concerted disinformation campaign because how impact can telling voter in florida and alaska to vote for trump or else have on voter compared with trump directly the proud_boy neo fascist street gang to stand back and stand by before television of million people and what kind of false tale of voter fraud could iran possibly seed that could undermine american faith in the electoral process more than the disinformation about voter fraud and mail in ballot coming straight the white_house and trump campaign don trust the electoral system don trust the cdc don trust your neighbor because they probably antifa don trust the left wardle of trump election message it not about persuading people way or the other it about making them scared and causing confusion and chaos she added the medium been obsessed with russian under the bed but to have the president of the united_state telling people in the u that they can trust the result of the election putin could only dream of that kind of thing disinformation campaign in the presidential_election had main vector social_medium campaign to sow division and distrust among voter and hack and leak operation that resulted in the theft and publication of email and document stolen democrat and hillary clinton campaign that hack and leak operation wa incredibly successful with cache of stolen material proving irresistible both for the mainstream press and for conservative activist and conspiracy theorist people have been overwhelmed with falsehood and confusion when people get overwhelmed they either fight or flee the iteration of the hack and leak tactic trump attorney rudy giuliani pushing dubious email and text message supposedly obtained hard drive linked to joe_biden son hunter ha been something of damp squib however you don see the same kind of credulous knee jerk out of control amplification that you saw in whitney phillips professor at syracuse university and author of report examining how the press served the purpose of medium manipulator troll and hate group in the top newspaper have debunked and deflated giuliani claim and the idea of the pilfered hard drive ha failed to capture the public interest in the same way that trove of stolen email did but while the trump election campaign may have failed to recapture the magic of when it come to hacked email the president ha taken social_medium playbook and supercharged it with the power of the white_house sure that there is some foreign influence stuff happening and we might more about it later phillips but so of the pollution is trickling down the white_house itself and people have been absolutely overwhelmed with falsehood and confusion over covid and ballot when people get overwhelmed they either fight or flee trump is making it almost impossible for people not to get totally burned out and disgusted this year disinformation effort on social_medium have taken aim at familiar societal fault line both operative and the in targeted with message designed to depress enthusiasm for clinton and suppress their vote similar effort especially those are under way this election shireen mitchell disinformation researcher and founder of stop online violence against woman there are group working to basically remove u the democratic party and tell u story that match what we going through speaks our language mitchell of campaign such a blexit and walk away version of black voter suppression that mitchell is monitoring encourages people to votedownballot but abstain voting for either presidential candidate because both candidate are the same often alongside the hashtag ado which stand for american descendant of slave jacobo licona disinformation researcher for equis lab he wa tracking prominent far right latino facebook page pushing false information about voting and anti black life matter message effort to paint biden a socialist are also particularly effective among cuban and venezuelan immigrant community he noted the false idea that biden is socialist or communist is also tactic in message targeting some asian american voter apparently effective attack suggesting that biden had opposed accepting refugee after the vietnam war spread like wildfire within the vietnamese american community the source of the canard appeared to be article that wa published in but went viral on facebook in october biden did support allowing vietnamese refugee to come the u while trump ha attacked all form of immigration reducing the number of refugee admitted each year to an older vietnamese were especially angry about that thu quach an epidemiologist who helped to found progressive volunteer organization fighting misinformation among vietnamese american through bilingual it take lot of deep work to continue these conversation because it so deeply embedded to be anti communist and conservative feed off that to paint biden and harris a communist tech platform after belatedly and begrudgingly admitting their tool had been used to ill end in have made reform that some of the old tactic obsolete the trump campaign of facebook to target black voter with voting deterrence message recently confirmed by is the kind of digital dirty trickery that should no_longer be possible every newsroom should be very very careful about what they publish because they are going to become tool in the fight such reform may be reason trump ha been so openly fanning the flame of political violence whether through his debate message to the proud_boy or his call for his supporter to become poll watcher joan donovan research director at harvard shorenstein center on medium politics and public policy they ve had to adapt to more mass medium strategy she of the trump campaign if you can utilize those other mechanism then you have to the megaphone trump blatant racism and ugly attack on black woman the democratic vice presidential nominee kamala harris and the congresswoman ilhan omar could also have the effect of suppressing turnout among black voter phillips simply by demoralizing people and inducing despair if certain people feel just crushed under the weight of so bullshit trump is going to be the to benefit she a volunteer like quach work to fight false narrative and voter confusion ahead of election however expert warn that the greatest scope for disinformation may still be to come the surge in mail in ballot is likely to delay the final result and trump ha repeatedly telegraphed his intention to declare premature victory or dismiss the election a rigged we going to look back at and realize that it all going to play out pm on tuesday wardle misinformation flourish when there vacuum or confusion and my fear is that there be lot of confusion and whoever succeeds in controlling the narrative be very placed in al gore never fully recovered television network premature declaration that george bush had won florida wardle noted that made all the difference she we that trump closest circle is ready to deploy we that the militia are ready to deploy what we don is if newsroom are ready for the absence of information wardle added every newsroom should be very very careful about what they publish because they are going to become tool in the fight and it going to be nasty energy minister say moscow also focus on clean burning hydrogen and carbon capture ha no plan to rein in it production of fossil fuel in the coming decade despite the global effort to shift towards low carbon energy according to it energy minister alexander novak told the guardian that did not see that we achieve peak in gas production anytime soon because the world appetite for gas would continue to grow in the decade ahead despite it growing number of climate target instead during in the battle to keep lid on rising global temperature pair growth in gas production with plan to become global leader in producing and developing technology intends to ramp up gas production it vast and inexpensive reserve to reach tn cubic meter year by just under bn cubic meter last year it also plan to increase the amount of gas it export on giant super chilled tanker more than four fold tonne year to tonne while continuing to send about bn cubic meter of gas to europe via pipeline the believe natural gas to be an eco friendly energy source novak we believe that the share of natural gas in the global energy mix only increase we believe this to apply not only to but globally too energy economist forecast that demand for gas continue to grow particularly in asia a more country draw line on burning coal which emits almost double the carbon dioxide of gas but eu demand for gas of which is met by state gas monopoly gazprom could fall below level by the end of the decade according to novak also planned to become global player in the hydrogen economy by producing and transporting the clean burning alternative to traditional fossil fuel gas hydrogen can be produced either by using renewable energy to split water molecule in process known a electrolysis or by splitting off the carbon dioxide gas through pyrolysis novak wa able to do both and wa also developing technology to capture the carbon emission created during hydrogen production to offer genuinely green gas to it customer using existing gas transport channel all this ha been quite expensive so far but we believe that just like with the renewable energy source which determine the pace of hydrogen adoption to put it briefly we can produce

military expenditure roughly doubled between and when measured in exchange rate adjusted for purchasing power though of the budget is secret annual military spending probably stand somewhere between bn and bn say michael kofman of the centre for naval analysis tank in virginia that is around three time a a britain and close to of of that money ha been spent on kit in the past decade ha added around plane helicopter and drone estimate julian cooper of the university of birmingham whereas of armour in wa classified a legacy ie introduced into service more than three decade ago today fully is modern according to study published by the international institute for strategic study tank in london on september th warplane have gone being legacy to being modern in that the key investment were in precision missile like the land based iskander sea launched kalibr and air launched kh putting in range target across europe see map decade ago the idea that the navy could accurately hit target in syria warship in the caspian sea would have been science fiction note dmitry stefanovich of research institute in moscow it reality in european war the idea would be to such missile to threaten civilian and military infrastructure deep behind the front line on the ground ensuring that conflict over tallinn would stretch far to the west of the rhine ultimate aim is to create reconnaissance strike complex originally soviet idea in which data vehicle on the ground drone in the air satellite in space and radio signal emitted by enemy unit are collected processed and fed into the weapon in real any sensor for instance drone can feed target to any shooter like faraway ship with target prioritised centrally and struck ideally within minute though is behind america and probably china in this ambitious endeavour it ha made huge leap say dima adamsky of herzliya university in israel force are not just better armed but also more fleet footed thanks to improvement in readiness could probably get troop complete with heavy armour to european hotspot within day might struggle to muster half the number of lighter force in that around of airborne troop are to be on hour notice soldier are kept on their toe with huge exercise the latest kavkaz caucasus involved personnel and concluded on september th ha traded mass for tempo concludes lt general jim hockenhull britain chief of defence intelligence armed force enjoy the additional advantage of being blooded in battle though and china may have comparable weapon the quality of the force in training and combat experience is night and say mr kofman in ukraine for instance ha practised armoured warfare and artillery duel experimenting with the of cyber attack and drone to feed targeting information to it gun syria where over personnel have served ha been testbed for precision strike air defence against rebel drone swarm and the of unmanned vehicle officer in syria have shown sign of shedding the soviet legacy of rigid top down command and acting with more autonomy and creativity practice known a mission command observes mr adamsky that he say would be major departure the military tradition and in both country ha honed it skill in electronic warfare by jamming radio radar and drone fake signal in syria were strong enough to bamboozle civilian airliner in israel not everything ha been fixed of course viktor murakhovsky former officer who edits military journal is positive about the reform but he say that shipbuilding is slow and that the country lag behind it rival in range drone the armata tank the next generation su warplane and submarine have all been delayed though is adept at blowing thing up in space it ageing fleet of reconnaissance satellite ha shrunk over the year with modernisation complicated by western sanction the biggest problem of all say mr kofman is the limited capacity of defence industry shortage of skilled personnel machine tool and component the trade off between hardware and human is also apparent though troop no_longer go hungry their pay is not great mr murakhovsky point out that skilled tank commander in his can expect little more than ruble month in peacetime lower than the national average in my opinion it not enough morale among conscript who still up of ground force remains low and the short duration of their service limit their usefulness in combat though the day of renting out warplane may be over last year military prosecutor announced that military official had been charged with corruption the amount stolen totalled around nor ha military renaissance bought peace of mind in war with would have conventional superiority for limited period concludes the but would be outgunned if the conflict dragged on in recent year mr putin ha therefore worked to ensure that conflict would not drag on he ha invested heavily in nuclear force unveiling host of lurid weapon such a hypersonic glider radioactive torpedo designed to pollute coastal area and nuclear powered cruise_missile capable of circling the earth indefinitely missile like the iskander kalibr and kh can also carry both conventional and nuclear warhead official point out that they would have no way of knowing which until they landed for general the hope is that their revived strength mean that the nuke are never needed for it ha largely focused on threat to the

cyberwar the economic restructuring humiliated and impoverished of it citizen thanks to demand that it quickly privatize it state enterprise under the leadership of vladimir spy himself chose to deploy low cost high impact and other country in order to reclaim it role on the world stage any country with decent internet expertise can readily develop and deploy digital power in cyberwar example include china north_korea saudi arabia and israel in such war there is no for big defense budget or big army and there is no to stockpile arm furthermore cyberwar technology advantage can augment country conventional arm by for example providing it with early warning of an imminent attack the goal and tactic of cyberwar are not different those of the cold_war the main player stayed the same and the or more generally east and west bloc ha the relative advantage in this ongoing war between the bloc it can deploy it internet technology and big data and numerous social_medium platform to attack the in broad daylight can target any political candidate party and voter group and influence their behavior more accurately than sharp shooter and it could wreck havoc on the financial transportation health and energy system and bring american life to halt overall goal is to undermine the democratic way of life in the western world and especially in the it ha already demonstrated that it can interfere with american social and political fabric and sow hatred and divisiveness among it social and political group and there is plenty of evidence that it ha in britain france germany and other country the must wake up and measured response it must fully acknowledge that this cyberwar is no le dangerous than the cold_war second it must mobilize it technological might help the internet private industry to stop the offensive such an effort may already be in place but it must be scaled way up and be given the urgency it deserves third the must mount counterattack against cyberwar infrastructure fourth the must retaliate and interfere with the functioning of society and it foreign_policy eye for an eye byte for byte finally the should consider building coalition with other country akin to nato which have been invaded digitally by to stop it cyber offensive these measure could also help the blunt conventional success in the middle_east ukraine eastern europe and

not shady actor on facebook or troll when it come to false claim about mail in voting trump twitter account function a press release say who led the team of researcher at harvard university trump tweet their way into headline which are amplified by the republican national committee his campaign staff and the white_house communication team benkler say both right_wing outlet and mainstream medium have helped trump spread false message benkler say journalist don want to side or appear biased he say so trump outrageous claim are put in headline with fact check saying they false few paragraph down in the story in august the researcher started seeing more of the early on this basic desire to grab headline really helped him get his message outside of those inside the propaganda feedback loop and into the more mainstream benkler say cornell university study that analyzed million article about the pandemic found mention of trump made up nearly of what they call this make the president the largest driver of falsehood about the pandemic around the world and here in the united_state benkler team find trump and other republican are the biggest driver of falsehood about voting medium outlet have adopted dual track where they report trump claim to look balanced and then go back to fact check benkler say but what initially reported matter most he say nobody read the fact check except for people who already want to find out that the president is lying he say you really do to do the fact checking before the headline is written and the headline and the lead to teach the audience what youre about to hear is false then you can really contain it the york post story on hunter biden serf a an example of how news outlet can contain misinformation he say robin young brings more than year of broadcast experience to her role a host of here allison hagan is here now freelance digital producer support the news support the news war and revolution are not inimical to moscow if they follow path policymakers understand and support the current unrest in different part of the former soviet_union may it tempting to that is losing control over it neighbourhood and it is true that over some area it hold ha weakened loss of ukraine is undeniable and serious however the current ruction do not mark decline but demonstrate rather the opposite is working on settlement for nagorno_karabakh and belarus and doing so according to it own principle meanwhile the west lack workable leverage over either issue may appear on the back foot if misunderstands it aim by assuming that in nagorno_karabakh it stand unconditionally behind armenia it collective security treaty organisation ally whose control of nagorno_karabakh in azerbaijan relies on military support it is also wrong to assume that in belarus moscow stand fully behind alyaksandr lukashenka the authoritarian leader who ha declared his friendship towards though not always lived up to it in fact moscow is quite tired of lukashenka faced behaviour and would like to see change in minsk it might also accept some change in nagorno_karabakh a a it happens on moscow term or at_least on term understandable to moscow true aim in these neighbourhood conflict is not to back particular side or personality but to defend the principle it value it want to delegitimise bottom up revolution a mean of transferring power it also want to signal that western interventionism with it promotion of democracy and normative approach are unfruitful in general and unwelcome around in particular what is playing out is essentially the same philosophy that guided intervention in syria and if judged against these criterion moscow is doing enough at_least at the moment moscow want to delegitimise bottom up revolution a mean to arrange transfer of power in belarus for instance moscow might be backing lukashenka for but in reality it is already working on his replacement this process some lukashenka have some over the term of his exit recent meeting he held with opposition figure in jail wa probably of this process svitlana tsikhanouskaya though the opposition_leader based in lithuania and the likely real winner of the rigged election ha probably been prescribed the role of bystander by moscow and so ha europe the start moscow ha shunned all european call for due procedure respect for human_right and mediation by the osce vladimir_putin last week encapsulated his country position though somewhat hypocritically when he did not interfere in what wa happening in belarus and we expect no else to interfere either no should be stirring up this conflict to promote their own interest and impose any decision on the belarusian people nagorno_karabakh is different type of conflict of an ethnic territorial kind and the onslaught of fighting with an azerbaijan emboldened by turkish support might suggest that is facing rival power in it neighbourhood but for in moscow the advantage of having the west out still outweighs the nuisance of having turkey in moscow know ankara and ha learned to work with it the capital are far being ally their goal in the middle_east often stand in direct opposition to each_other but both realise they each_other a they cannot achieve their aim without some acquiescence the other and most importantly the turkish government is motivated by goal that in the kremlin eye are rational strengthening it power at home enhancing it leverage abroad and pursuing economic and security interest it lack any western style rule centric approach and instead subscribes to worldview that moscow understands azerbaijan too ha pursued it foreign_policy without challenging philosophical standpoint or historical narrative though at time it ha been at odds with moscow this is why might be more relaxed than expected though it armenian ally is in trouble may have reason to help it ally armenia but it ha no reason at all to punish azerbaijan which ha been an example of model behavior among the former soviet state a far a is concerned carnegie scholar alexander baunov in nagorno_karabakh it is again moscow that ha brought the warring side together and arranged for ceasefire though an admittedly shaky the western member of the contact group have largely been european have tried different way to influence the situation in belarus lithuania for instance ha positioned itself on the moral high ground arranged public show of solidarity with the belarusian opposition and called for harsh sanction against the regime france ha on dialogue with putin trying to get the latter to accept osce mediation collectively eu leader made great effort in august to signal to moscow their restraint and desire not to geopoliticise the conflict in the hope that moscow would mirror the position thus allowing for an armenian style political transition with no geopolitical contest around it all to no avail after adopting wait and see position for around week after the election moscow made up it mind and embarked on strategy of transition that save some face for lukashenka deepens leverage in the country brings to power leader acceptable to moscow keep both the west and the osce at arm length and most importantly demonstrates that popular revolution is not an effective way to transfer power can imagine scenario under which moscow could reconsider it approach change strategy and reach out to the lithuania based opposition but all these would stem development inside belarus itself such a strike that paralyse the country or the regime splitting and crumbling rather_than something the west doe or say the lesson for the west is clear enough to influence post_soviet or any crisis need to have true leverage either on the regional level or on the global level that it can convert to regional influence if relies solely on good principle and the moral high ground it is very easy to be outmanoeuvred in the face of determined opponent nthe european council on foreign

governed another continent demonstration in support of governor sergei furgal in khabarovsk july khabarovsk the largest city in far_east is known for it classical architecture winter ice sculpture and the country longest running protest for more than hundred consecutive day thousand have taken to the street waving flag holding picket and staging march the protest were sparked in july by the arrest of the region former governor sergei furgal charismatic businessman and local politician furgal scored surprise electoral victory over his predecessor vyacheslav shport the kremlin preferred candidate in in dramatic scene earlier this year he wa pulled out of his car and arrested by federal officer who had been flown in directly moscow he stand accused of involvement in series of murder of business rival in the region in the early the incident ha since become focus point for frustration in the far_east while protestors initially demanded furgal release the moscow jail where he is being held and for his case to be tried locally their chant are more often broad criticism of both president_vladimir putin and moscow commentator have been quick to speculate that these protest in region where they had previously been unheard of mark the beginning of an organized moderate alternative to putin however the reality is far more complex the liberal democratic party of to which furgal and his ally belong is far that moderate movement in reality it ha tended more toward than liberalism calling for expansion into ukraine and belarus in the party representative in the state duma proposed bill banning the of foreign loanword which would have fined politician and the public for using english word when there is alternative the initiative failed to gain support get briefed on the story of the week and developing story to watch across the asia pacific instead while those taking to the street have vented frustration at the kremlin their complaint appear to be le about domestic policy than regional autonomy the scion of prominent khabarovsk family furgal local credential were key to his popular support a protestor pointed out normally the governor are sent to the region moscow but furgal wa different he helped u his arrest and the appointment of mikhail degtyarev moscow politician a his interim replacement created narrative that the kremlin wa interfering in local affair afar expansive east beginning at the urals and stretching through siberia to the sea of japan ha had an uneasy balance with it western center since the day of imperial it town and city have been seen a mere extension of the european nation an asian frontier to be settled and tamed a of the soviet_union mass deportation eastward and it status a destination for gulag prisoner reinforced that notion but a the protester in khabarovsk show far_east might be forming it own identity major point of contention is that while eastern hold of the country natural resource oil gas and rare earth metal the proceeds their extraction are widely seen to line pocket in the west rather_than enriching local community series of environmental catastrophe in the far_east such a petrochemical spill that led to the in october angered local who feel like they are being left to pick up the piece while is often stereotyped a ethnically homogeneous around percent of siberian are minority ethnic group and the far_east is home to more than distinct culture unlike the rest of the country protestant congregation far outnumber those belonging to the moscow based orthodox church in the th century ukrainian were encouraged to settle along the southeastern limit of the far_east the border with china to the sea of okhotsk the scheme wa so successful that after the bolshevik revolution of ukrainian majority area centered on khabarovsk attempted to declare their independence a green ukraine siberian regionalism or a it is known ha history but in recent year it ha faced source of opposition after the fall of the soviet_union region enjoyed unprecedented level of local autonomy with the federal government either too weak or ineffective to impose it on their administration however since putin ha embarked upon to strengthen the vertical power structure leading place like khabarovsk to the kremlin his hand picked governor like the candidate that furgal defeated in have been the linchpin of that plan historically moscow ha used the precarious geography of the far_east against those who sought to distance themselves it power with china eastern border beginning just across the river khabarovsk the threat of expansionism and the for protection wa compelling argument against going it alone but china presence in the far_east is being felt in an altogether different way beijing is behind billion of dollar of investment in the region fueling both the stagnating economy but and with the local population medium ha repeatedly claimed a fact narrative that chinese investment ha been accompanied by mass chinese migration to the far_east creating fear that the region is within beijing sight the reality that the ha done little to assuage those concern internet documentary china deadly friend went viral in with claim that chinese tank could roll into central khabarovsk in under minute in granting series of concession to chinese firm moscow ha itself become with local fearing their home is being offered up a raw material supplier for the people republic of china regional election in september gave clear sign that those tension are coming to the fore elsewhere in siberia opposition candidate handed rare defeat to the ruling united party with ally of poisoned opposition politician alexei navalny gaining seat in the central asian city of tomsk and novosibirsk while navalny blend of ethnic nationalism might have made him an unlikely figure for young russian to unite around his prominence a critic of the kremlin made his bloc the de facto choice for protest vote while some in far_east do occasionally speak of an independent united_state of siberia the idea lack prominent supporter or any realistic prospect of success however the tension behind it and the growing resistance to being directly governed another continent continue to define relation between center and it extremity for those in far_east moscow might seem like world away with eight zone and five train journey dividing

energetic bear is among stealthiest it appears to be casting wide net to find useful target ahead of the election expert by cybersecurity official watched with growing alarm in september a state hacker started prowling around dozen of american state and local government computer system just month before the election the act itself did not worry them so official anticipated that the russian who interfered in the election would be back but the actor did the group known to researcher a dragonfly or energetic bear for it hackings of the energy sector wa not involved in election hacking but it ha in the past five year breached the power grid water treatment facility and nuclear power plant it also hacked into wi_fi system at san francisco international airport and at_least other west coast airport in march in an apparent bid to find unidentified traveler demonstration of the hacker power and resolve september intrusion marked the that researcher caught the group unit of federal security service or targeting state and county the timing of the attack so close to the election and the potential for disruption set off concern inside private security firm law_enforcement and intelligence agency possible explanation is that they are calling in the real pro the team who is used to operating in this really sensitive critical infrastructure where you want to keep quiet until you don suzanne spaulding the former under secretary for cybersecurity and critical infrastructure at the department of homeland_security in hacker other group were unusually noisy in their effort to penetrate some state election database you could argue they didn care about being quiet m spaulding but that ha been called out and punished for interfering in the election president_vladimir putin may want to keep this quiet until the circumstance are set for their in information operation she added american official described the hackings in an advisory on thursday a opportunistic rather_than clear attack on election infrastructure but conceded the group had targeted dozen of state and local system and stolen data at_least target server they broadly looking to scan for vulnerability and they working christopher krebs the director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency which issued the warning along with the that hardly reassured researcher who have tracked energetic bear for year this appears to be preparatory to ensure access when they decide they it adam meyers the head of threat intelligence at crowdstrike security firm that ha monitored the group energetic bear typically cast wide net then zero in on few high value target in germany and the united_state the group ha infected website popular in the energy sector downloading malware onto the machine of anyone who visited the site then searching for employee with access to industrial system in other attack it ha hijacked the software update for computer attached to industrial control system it ha also blasted target with phishing email in search of employee or co worker who might have access to critical system at water power and nuclear plant and it ha done so with disturbing screenshot in showed the group hacker with their finger on the switch of the computer that controlled the industrial system at power plant the group ha thus far stopped short of sabotage but appears to be preparing for some future attack the hackings so unnerved official that starting in the united_state cyber_command the arm of the pentagon that conduct offensive cyberattacks hit back some called the counterattack the digital era equivalent of mutually assured destruction but any hope that american official had that their strike would deter dissipated when the group started targeting american airport in march official at san francisco international airport discovered state hacker had breached the online system that airport employee and traveler used to gain access to the airport wi_fi the hacker injected code into wi_fi portal that stole visitor user name cracked their password and infected their laptop the attack began on march and continued for nearly week until it wa shut_down by then official at other airport discovered their wi_fi portal had also been compromised researcher would not name the other victim citing nondisclosure agreement but they were on the west coast a pervasive a the attack could have been researcher believe hacker were interested only in specific person traveling through the airport that ostensibly hundred of thousand of people could have been compromised eric chien cybersecurity director at symantec who examined the attack but only were mr chien team discovered that the hacker were fingerprinting the machine of anyone who logged onto the wi_fi network in search of older version of microsoft internet explorer browser if they found match the hacker infected those laptop if the wi_fi visitor used any other browser the hacker left them alone what we could see they were going after specific individual mr chien in the government alert on thursday official that the group wa again targeting aviation system it did not name the target but did suggest in some technical language that could have been the airport in columbus ohio in previous homeland_security warning about the group official it target low security and small network to gain access and move laterally to network of major high value asset owner within the energy sector security researcher warned that the spate of attack on american state and local system could mirror the trajectory of those attack hacker using their foothold in seemingly random victim network to mine for more interesting target closer to the election on nov they could step like pulling offline the database that verify voter signature on mail in ballot or given their particular expertise shutting power to key precinct the most disconcerting piece is that it demonstrates intent and ability to target system near and dear to u but that shouldn surprise u frank cilluffo the director of auburn university mccrary institute for cyber and critical infrastructure security by deputizing the stealthiest infrastructure hacker to target state and local system some security expert believe may be hedging it bet if for example mr putin belief president trump be elected and want to forge better relationship with the united_state he may want to limit the degree to which is seen a interfering likewise the expert if former vice_president joseph biden jr the democratic nominee is elected may try to it foothold in the system to weaken or delegitimize him or it may hold back so a not to provoke the administration by doing this more quietly you give yourself more option m spaulding advertisement section tv featured more nbc follow nbc_news washington intelligence and cybersecurity official they see no sign that hacker have tried to infiltrate the election infrastructure the way they did in when all state were probed and voter roll in some state were accessed official also that when it come to cyber defense this is but those same official acknowledge that there is no way to protect every state county and precinct network infiltration by hacker and that the russian or another foreign power could still decide to mount cyber offensive to disrupt the election expert this is unlikely because it would mean crossing red line that could provoke serious reaction the government and they it would be extremely difficult for hacker to actually change vote tally but if an adversary decided to attack here are the way expert the russian or le likely or the chinese could cyber technique to cause an election nightmare imagine an infrastructure attack maybe in some key precinct or state swing state for the election where maybe power go out or maybe the service go out frank figliuzzi the fbi former chief and an nbc_news contributor or you cant your credit card or pump gas just something that sow discord and confusion official have the russian have planted cyber bomb on american power grid and communication network to be triggered at later date if desired perhaps the most ruthless and effective way the russian could disrupt the election would be to shut_down the power or the cellphone service in few critical area making it impossible to vote this is perhaps the most frightening scenario but also the least likely because such an attack could be considered an act of war and the might feel compelled to retaliate not just with cyberattack but also military response a the recent spate of attack on hospital ha shown ransomware is devastating method of cyberattack that is extremely hard to stop all it take is computer user clicking on malicious link thereby opening network to malware that encrypts all the data and turn computer into brick unless ransom is paid to unlock it the ransomware attack against hospital are being carried out by speaking eastern european criminal group expert but nothing prevents the government deploying similar group the state often work with criminal hacker official to attack american election recent ransomware attack against local government system in hall county georgia ha slowed the election department capacity to count absentee ballot official there have voting machine themselves aren connected to the internet but ransomware attack against county or precinct could shut_down critical supporting network that could it difficult to conduct the election in swing state the impact could be huge weve seen an increase in the of ransomware by folk who maybe couldnt write it themselves but it available out on the black market and they can buy it matt drake former fbi election threat specialist with defense contractor saic and it certainly concerning that if it were launched shortly before the election it could be difficult for some place to overcome that on primary in some voter showed up to the poll in riverside county california only to learn that their voter_registration information had been changed online their party affiliation had been switched and they couldn vote in their preferred primary baffled voter insisted they hadn made the change the local district attorney concluded the voter roll had been hacked and if they had chosen to do so could have tampered on large enough scale to seriously disrupt the election they they haven detected hack of voter roll this cycle but that doesn mean there haven been any or won be imagine if the russian or some other adversary deleted every third voter_registration record in three pennsylvania county and voter showed up only to be turned away in knox county tennessee during mayoral primary official distributed denial of service or ddos attack shut_down county website publishing election result the county had to mail out the official tally the actual vote wa not affected but some member of the public weren able to see the result on election night in presidential_election the associated_press and other news organization deploy reporter all over the country to eyeball official result and send them in so it would be difficult for hacker to blind the country to most of the result large medium company have strategy to defend against ddos attack but reporter can be everywhere if these attack which are easy to carry out were deployed against local government on large scale around the country expert they could disrupt and delay the dissemination of some election result and undermine confidence in the vote the most plausible threat

into brics following south africa accession the five brics country together represent over billion people or about percent of the world population published on by on october prime_minister atal bihari vajpayee and president_vladimir putin cemented india bilateral tie with the signing of the historical agreement the decade since the signing of the agreement bilateral_relation are hailed to have chartered level of cooperation amid fast changing regional and global scenario while shouldering mutual_interest and concern the strategic_partnership ha been at the cusp of litmus test a it ha endured event such a the terrorist attack colour revolution the georgian war the economic depression in the mumbai attack the crimean referendum and it aftermath and the current covid pandemic it is therefore worth reflecting on the decade of seemingly positive bilateral engagement between india and it is important to analyse how the agreement signed in ha played role in the continuum of ensuring the mutual understanding peaceful cooperation and reliability between the strategic partner this is also an opportunity to critically evaluate the magnitude of our strategic relationship and the change in the foreign_policy priority since given the current global context the key question is how prepared are india and for insulating the strategic_partnership amid the challenge in the post pandemic world the declaration of strategic_partnership wa signed at when the momentum in the bilateral_relation between india and post_soviet collapse had fatigued due to several factor but the most crucial factor of them all wa the renewal of the the renewed treaty had almost written off the bilateral engagement a clarified that it wa no_longer willing to any defence commitment during the of any external military threat to india key security clause article ix that constituted the very core of the indo soviet treaty the strategic_partnership treaty signed in gave lease of life a it restored india relation to respectable level both the country realised the to develop multifaceted bilateral cooperation in all possible sphere of defence energy space nuclear science and technology etc india strategic_partnership with since then ha been unique intense and substantive in way mainly the treaty led to the of high level political interaction through annual bilateral summit key feature of the agreement to foster extensive collaboration and dynamism in the partnership the twenty annual bilateral summit held so far between india and have in particular seen major agreement and initiative undertaken to strengthen the partnership to higher level additionally in the bilateral tie were further elevated with the signing of the arguably the partnership between the country ha been successfully reflected in instance at regional and global platform general assembly referendum against for it accession of crimea in and unequivocal support to india on the kashmir issue are few case in point regarding strategic_partnership in sensitive sphere of cooperation between india and defence cooperation continues to be of the major booster for engagement between the country india ha acknowledged contribution in assisting the former in military power projection and preserving it national_security interest although in recent time there is downgrading in the purchase of defence equipment by india the cooperation in this sphere ha been unassailable given that it ha progressed buyer seller relation to joint research development and production high end technology transfer that ha encouraged india quest for indigenous defence capability the induction of in vikramaditya to the joint production of brahmos missile india defence cooperation ha achieved capacity through acquisition and joint development in fact resurgence a military power in recent time is conducive to india domestic initiative such a the in india project the finalising of the despite the threat of imposition of caatsa sanction ha shown india predictable resistance to external pressure given it historical tie with indo nuclear cooperation constitutes an important element of our strategic_partnership the kudankulam nuclear power plant knpp ha become of the biggest success story of india cooperation a unit and unit start commercial operation the process for reactor building of unit and have already begun with the construction of nuclear power plant planned india nuclear cooperation ha indeed reached height india and bangladesh signed trilateral agreement in march for the construction of npp in rooppur bangladesh ha been another major element of the strategic_partnership since an export oriented energy country aim to leverage it energy card with india an import oriented energy market india interest in the arctic for instance especially energy resource are crucial aspect for india growing energy security need this is seen a great step towards strengthening india energy cooperation the bilateral partnership which ha global strategic connotation ha seen both the country promote the idea of building multipolar world order and changing the global financial structure in this regard both india and have envisaged promoting harmonious global order based on international law and collective decision making that includes developing country and is not monopolised by developed country alone india and along with other player such a china have succeeded in establishing non western organisation such a brics and sco the member state have within their capability and limitation established mechanism that address economic and strategic interest such a the development bank while brics and sco have become tool of political signalling on issue related to global affair there however exist asymmetry among the member state with regard to economic growth performance distribution of resource and military strength additionally although china is member of such multilateral organisation at the individual level beijing ha exercised assertive posturing that ha caused concern in india this can be seen by it irrational border claim and action in the indian ocean region the role of especially during the of crisis between india and china is therefore anticipated to be non partisan and meaningful when the treaty of strategic_partnership wa signed in the world wa at the brink of war on terrorism after the terrorist attack on the world trade centre both india and at their respective level joined the bandwagon on the global war on terror both party a bilateral partner which have been victim of terrorist attack voiced their interest and concern in combating terrorism and related activity india and have therefore cooperated at bilateral and multilateral level for instance india and also share the mutual_interest of preventing the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction and their possible acquisition by terrorist group while both india and assert their distinctive identity in world politics respectively the strategic_partnership ha seen close coordination of foreign_policy interest to wide range of international and regional issue both country firmly believe that intensification of the indo strategic_partnership can help respond to the challenge thrown up by global change in more effective way while both india and have diverging approach on the indo pacific narrative cannot deny that the country understand the for in accordance with the universally accepted principle of international law this includes combating piracy at sea and providing humanitarian aid during natural disaster the country have shown keen interest in restoring peace and stability in afghanistan eurasian integration ha been key priority in the india strategic_partnership understands that in it quest for greater eurasia india is vital player for it huge market potential economic growth performance military strength and enhanced position in international affair strategic_partnership in between india and since the soviet_era and ha continued to remain today in fact both country have agreed to expand their relation in the aerospace sphere an area of traditional cooperation for decade more than joint project involving scientist and research institute both country have been undertaken within the framework of various initiative since while critically evaluating the decade of strategic_partnership between india and it is tempting to compare india strategic_partnership with other major global player and the strategic_partnership that it share with the reality of the dynamic nature of international relation have definitely posed challenge to the partnership the pursuing of an all alignment foreign_policy ha caused certain level of discomfort in the bilateral_relation india growing proximity with the and compromised defence cooperation with china and mending of tie with pakistan in recent time ha caused anxiety in the strategic_partnership between india and possible inference that can draw is the constant comparison to the current india partnership with that of the nostalgia of indo soviet tie but need to bear in mind that compared to the strategic_partnership that both india and share with other major player there are limitation and shrouded with lack of trust india defence relation with for instance is yet to any substantive development in joint production and restrictiveness about it technology compared to generosity to sharing defence technology and relation with pakistan is eclipsed with lack of trust and understanding a for china relation there is growing speculation of possible role reversal in the partnership given china growth in global politics in recent time however there are few stumbling block in india defence cooperation especially the shifting trend in partnership for example defence engagement between and china current cooperation with china ha emerged exclusively a it includes cooperation in sensitive field such a strategic missile defence hypersonic technology and the construction of nuclear submarine with allowing for the latter to be equipped with similar and more advanced capability china is major security concern for india hence given the way collaboration in advanced future weapon system quantum technology and artificial intelligence should be enhanced further between india and indo relation are undoubtedly at the cusp of litmus test nonetheless the strategic_partnership should see the future of asia beyond the and china factor and both india and can play decisive role in promoting their mutual_interest in the region the rapid and uncontrollable spread of covid in the past seven month ha impacted the global order and the interconnected system reflecting the spirit of the partnership in time of crisis also welcomed india goodwill gesture to send medical supply to help fight the virus critic have often pointed out that the strategic_partnership is yet to achieve it full potential given the fact that some of the sphere of cooperation continue to be remain obsolete for instance the economic relation additionally given nearly year of diplomatic relation soft power capability cultural diplomacy academic exchange programme and labour migration are at an imperceptible status trade and investment remains the weakest link in our strategic_partnership and fall far short of our potential which unfortunately is not commensurate with our high level political cooperation post the announcement of the strategic agreement in which largely promotes the strengthening of economic relation between india and the trade cart received required upgrade potential area of trade have been explored which include trade and investment energy nuclear science and technology pharmaceutical it steel diamond fertilizer infrastructure heavy engineering and food product exploring economic prosperity sustainable development and free movement of people information knowledge idea and greater institutional link ha also become crucial in fact both country have set target of in each_other country by the year it is also heartening that option are being explored to further expand the domain of economic cooperation eurasian integrity regional cooperation free trade agreement connectivity and trade corridor have gained the utmost importance in the annual bilateral summit in the past decade the country have also set up mechanism such a commission for example irigc tec the international north south transport corridor and the eurasian economic union which have emerged a immediate priority area for strong economic cooperation between the country the far_east is another region for potential economic engagement india presence in the eastern economic forum eef is aimed at developing trade commerce investment railway infrastructure steel plant defence space port and shipping india ha successfully participated in the annual eef with prime_minister for the development of the far_east other than these development our economic tie are focused on exploring the potential of sub regional cooperation sub regional cooperation ha emerged a of the prospective area of cooperation and regional connectivity to add further impetus to the economic cooperation between india and the key goal is to cement and cooperation between the state and union territory of the republic of india and province of the federation to further bolster india far ambition an of four indian state led by the commerce and industry minister of india piyush goyal visited vladivostok to explore the opportunity and potential of business to business cooperation in the far with the introduction of the in the world the for both india and to tap the potential of agricultural sector is crucial regional connectivity need due attention hence the successful execution of alternative economic corridor and maritime trade corridor such a chennai vladivostok need prompt engagement the major impact of the pandemic ha prompted country to explore alternate market destination and shift in the business environment the crisis ha opened opportunity for country such a india and to reposition themselves in the global supply chain with it effort to attract investment to the far_east and india with it huge manpower and existing available manufacturing unit should be endorsed a potential and suitable alternative for manufacturing instead of developed nation despite the seemingly successful bilateral_relation between india and the strategic community is incomplete if there is shortfall in establishing strong people to people engagement since the soviet_collapse bilateral_relation have seen minimal cultural diplomacy academic exchange and labour migration perhaps vista of cooperation could be explored to promote soft power capability between the country such a cinema which ha always been of the most successful foreign_policy tool to enhance cultural exchange and people to people contact between country the film industry is great medium for spreading narrative and in india movie have an immense following a a impact on the mind of the population india and collaborated in movie production during the soviet_era however the trend did not last due to the fall of the soviet_union among other factor the is right for both india and to collaborate in the entertainment industry especially through joint production of movie and creating powerful narrative related to bilateral cooperation india and must concentrate more on the content of the movie rather_than joint production alone a for the audience the content matter more than the producer moreover it can have an everlasting impact on the mind of the indian population if the content project character aiding collaborating with an indian protagonist in movie in bringing down an antagonist also the indian movie industry is always on the look for exotic location in foreign land hence in order to attract the indian movie industry could look into easing travel and other shooting permission within it jurisdiction such an effort would not only bring closer industry tie but also be able to showcase the and it rich culture to the indian population thereby acting a window of promotion for tourism regarding geopolitical realignment today the global community is seeking pragmatic the role of india and is crucial in their effort to diffuse the multipolar world system this is also relevant for regional alliance to actively engage politically and economically which should help bilateral_relation between the country elevate to higher pedestal in post pandemic world order the current global situation ha given rise to some daunting challenge for the partnership once again some of the are linked to the disruption being caused to the international order by traditional and non traditional threat such a climate change secure communication challenge etc nurturing hope for stability and prosperity in eurasia in the post pandemic world bilateral_relation between india and and their proactive role in regional mechanism such a sco eurasian economic union eaeu and india china ric are viewed a an integral of this construct regional connectivity need due attention the successful execution of alternative economic corridor and maritime trade corridor in conclusion the signing of the milestone agreement in wa the outcome of development that took place in bilateral_relation between india and after the fall of the soviet_union the main aim of the agreement wa to elevate the partnership to level of cooperation and put speculation and uncertainty in the relationship to rest over the past twenty year of relation the partnership ha seen ups and down nonetheless this ha not allowed any major damage that could impact or lead to any serious conflict of interest between the country having that the coveted relation built over the year cannot be taken for granted in this regard apart political elite and bureaucrat playing crucial role in enhancing the relation academician artist student the research community tank and educational institution should contribute to forming the true essence of the partnership the youth in particular to draw inspiration each_other rich history and cultural relevance carrying forward the vision for term partnership the engagement of both country in the international ecosystem in the post pandemic world ha become more relevant a it ha given rise to challenge and opportunity the strategic_partnership between india and nevertheless need to insulate the mutual_interest challenge that emerge within and external factor perhaps the for reality check and serious introspection be crucial a the challenge are only set to grow given the dynamism of international relation our partner published on by despite it large population of billion which have considered a an impediment china domestic economic reform and collaborative strategic diplomacy with external country have made it attain superpower status over the united_state while united_state influence is rapidly fading away china ha indeed taken up both the challenge and unique opportunity to strengthen especially it economic muscle on october vladimir_putin took via videoconference in the final plenary session of the annual meeting of the valdai international discussion club the valdai discussion club wa established in with goal is to promote dialogue between and international intellectual elite and to an independent unbiased scientific analysis of political economic and social event in and the rest of the world putin touched on wide range of different issue what particularly interesting wa his

humanity he during his interactive speech with the participant in effect the post war world order wa established by three victorious country the soviet_union the united_state and great britain the role of britain ha changed since then the soviet_union no_longer exists while some try to dismiss altogether according to putin indeed the soviet_union is no_longer there but there is in term of it economic weight and political influence china is moving quickly towards superpower status germany is moving in the same direction and the federal republic of germany ha become an important player in international cooperation at the same the role of great britain and france in international affair ha undergone significant change he further explained the united_state which at some point absolutely dominated the international stage can hardly claim exceptionality any longer generally speaking doe the united_state this exceptionalism he asked rhetorically and further cited that powerhouse such a brazil south africa and some other country have become more influential in the world amid the current fragmentation of international affair there are challenge that require more than just the combined capacity of few state very influential one problem of this magnitude which do exist require global attention international stability security fighting terrorism and solving urgent regional conflict are certainly among them a are promoting global economic development combating poverty and expanding cooperation in healthcare that last is especially relevant today arguably china ha worked on all that is recorded a it grandiose achievement it ha systematically transformed it economy at the same maintained the political structure it major city and coastal area are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior region it brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history china reduced extreme poverty by million a expected of any development process there are still problem nonetheless the level of public support for the government and it management of the country is high with of chinese citizen expressing satisfaction with the central government according to survey that compared with putin explained that ha to begin the scratch lenin spoke about the birthmark of capitalism he reminded and added that it cannot be that we have lived these past year in full fledged market economy in fact we are only gradually building it and it institution had to do it the ground up starting clean slate of course we are doing this taking into consideration

any future president of the united_state with the person who have the trust of the american people he we that president trump ha repeatedly spoken in favor of developing american relation we certainly appreciate that very he he blamed bipartisan consensus on the necessity of containing for limiting trump room for maneuver at the same putin criticized the trump administration for signing off on sanction and for withdrawing the intermediate range nuclear force treaty last year a for biden putin the democratic candidate used sharp anti rhetoric but that the kremlin wa encouraged by biden interest in preserving the start arm_control treaty originally negotiated by the obama administration that expires in february lipman caution that the prospect for better relation are bleak no matter who win if biden becomes president he may consolidate european ally against moscow she say while if trump is reelected his political opponent may pursue an harsher policy toward the only thing that help the kremlin lipman say is more polarization and turmoil in the united_state turmoil mean the united_state weakened she say this is what the kremlin can actually benefit not an improvement in relation this is the only thing that may hope for npr thanks our sponsor watch cbsn live cbs news in this episode of host michael morell interview general mcmaster senior_fellow at both stanford university hoover institution and it graduate school of business career army officer and national_security adviser to president trump he is also the author of his newly released book titled battleground the fight to defend the free world general mcmaster pass along advice on how the next president should handle relation with north_korea kim jong un give his insight on the effectiveness of our handling of and share his passion for helping those in venezuela michael_morrell general mcmaster welcome to intelligence matter it is an honor to have you on the show gen_mcmaster hey michael the honor mine is great to be with you michael_morrell let me start with couple of point for our listener want to congratulate you on your book ive read it it terrific it must read for anyone interested in national_security and actually see it a reference book for understanding the key issue and see myself pulling it down off the shelf to when im thinking about something want to have to talk about something when im writing something it very important contribution to the literature on the threat and challenge we face a nation so thank_you thank_you very for writing it gen_mcmaster michael thanks so mean it somebody with your background experience and knowledge to to endorse it like that that mean lot to me that you judge it to have been worthwhile thank_you michael_morrell second having you with u to talk about your book is perfect way for u to kick off what is for u going to be series on the key national_security issue facing the united_state the series which were going to work very hard to be nonpartisan run between the and the inauguration and finally should mention to my listener that this episode is going to run the after the election but that you and are taping it the friday before the election so you and have no idea whats going to happen on election so people should just that a theyre a theyre listening to our conversation and thats actually good thing for our conversation because what want to do at the end of the is get your sense of what is going to face the president who is sworn in on january th no matter who that person happens to be michael_morrell before we get to the individual issue that want to walk through with you id love to ask you why you decided to write the book that you did you obviously could have written very different kind of book and im sure that there were publisher who were encouraging you to do that but you chose not to do that you chose to write very serious look at the threat and challenge that face u a nation why did you the route that you did gen_mcmaster michael thank_you served in the army for thirty four year so a transitioned to what is my only second career in my adult life made out probably quite predictably mission statement for myself and that wa in my second career to try to deepen our understanding of the most crucial challenge we face a way to better inform the american people about foreign_policy and national_security issue and with the hope that if we learn more about these challenge that we face we can demand better demand better foreign_policy our elected leader but then also hope that the book and the work that im doing around the book help bring american back together right because dont any of these issue should be partisan in nature what im hoping for is that deeper understanding of these challenge we face and what should be our common commitment to try to build better future for generation to come help bring our country back together at_least around foreign_policy and national_security issue michael_morrell what are the main theme of the book what do you want reader to walk away remembering gen_mcmaster what are the theme that run through the book is this idea of strategic narcissism this is of the reason why our competence our ability to compete at_least in the post cold_war period ha been significantly diminished and by strategic narcissism mean our tendency to define the world only in relation to u and then to assume that what we decide to do or decide not to do is decisive to achieving favorable outcome and of course you michael with your experience with intelligence this is flawed because it self referential and it doesnt acknowledge you the degree to which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future so the book is then an argument an argument for cultivating with my friend and great historian zachary shore ha termed strategic empathy and this is an effort an effort to understand better what drive and constrains the other especially adversary rival and enemy and what drive and constrains the other often time is ideology and emotion and aspiration so the theme in the book that also is important is an effort to understand how the recent past produced the present a the step in making projection into the future so the book is an argument for the understanding of history and appreciation for the complex causality of event and focus on understanding these crucial challenge were facing the perspective the perspective of others michael_morrell you thats of the thats of the main job of the intelligence community right is to is to give our decision maker the point of view of the other guy the guy sitting across the table you the guy sitting across the battlefield you but whats the other guy thinking what are his constraint what are his interest and thats extraordinarily important right gen_mcmaster of course it not idea it go back to sun tzu but it we started to neglect the importance of this especially in the post cold_war period period that describe a period of over optimism over optimism that led to complacency and bit of hubris and this over optimism wa in large measure set up set of for significant disappointment in the thousand disappointment of course associated with the mass murder attack of september th but also the unanticipated length and difficulty of war in afghanistan and in iraq and of course followed by financial crisis and so it wa in the thousand that this emotional impetus behind our foreign_policy shifted overoptimism to pessimism and maybe tendency to under appreciate the risk and cost of action to tendency to underappreciate the risk and cost of inaction and that strategic narcissism is the cause really in both case michael_morrell you the other thing that strike me when you talk about the importance of history is always thought sitting in deputy meeting that it would have been incredibly valuable to actually few minute and every deputy meeting or principal meeting to talk about the history of the issue just to review how you got point to point and we never did that in multiple administration in which served but always thought that that would have been really valuable gen_mcmaster michael youre absolutely right about that ill tell you of the of the great gift had before earlier my career wa the opportunity to read thing study and write history and the book wrote wa which is story about how and why vietnam became an american war and of the lesson learned the study of that history wa that it wa important to understand problem and challenge holistically before leaping into action when came in a national_security adviser did my best to at_least avoid making the same mistake and we put in place principle small group framing session thats mouthful but a we developed these strategy for the most crucial challenge we were facing we began with this framing session that wa organized around five page paper that included only really the description of the challenge how we got to where we are bit of the history of it and then an inventory of our vital interest that were at stake view of that challenge through the lens of those vital interest and draft overarching goal and more specific objective followed by assumption assumption about the degree to which we and like minded partner have agency or influence over this challenge then an inventory of obstacle to progress and opportunity that we could exploit and thats it then we had discussion about the nature of the challenge the policy coordinating committee which you are the real worker who are going to work on this project theyre listening in so theyre getting theyre hearing at the cabinet level discussion about the nature of the problem and then refinement of it once that of the meeting wa done then we shifted to discussion of what are your idea how do we integrate the element of national power and effort of like minded partner to overcome these obstacle and exploit these opportunity then they got to hear the treasury secretary what we have we have economic and financial tool available but those ought to be combined with diplomacy and maybe law_enforcement effort and then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with so that hope thats process that be sustained dont my successor hung onto it it have to be resurrected at some point if it is deemed a useful by future national_security adviser michael_morrell im michael_morrell today we have with u mcmaster senior_fellow at both stanford university hoover institution and it graduate school of business career army officer and national_security adviser to president trump ok so what id love to do is go through the individual issue and what id like to do is just throw out get you to frame it whats the threat or challenge that we face whats the history how did we get here whats our interest thats at stake and how do you we a nation to go about dealing with it let start with the big let start with the big enchilada china gen_mcmaster china is great example of strategic narcissism at work and especially this assumption that we clung to for too that china having been welcomed into the international order would play by the rule would liberalize it economy and a it prospered it would liberalize it form of government of course thats not true thats not true because we undervalue the degree to which emotion and ideology drive and constrain the chinese communist_party and what would argue in battleground is that the party is driven mainly by fear fear of losing it exclusive grip on power and an associated ambition the ambition to achieve national rejuvenation for china to center stage in the world again after the tragedy a they portrayed a the century of humiliation it is that combination of fear and aspiration that is driving the party effort to extend and tighten it exclusive grip on power internally this is why there are over million people in concentration camp in xinjiang and there campaign of cultural genocide ongoing this is why the party is extending their repressive arm to hong kong and perfecting their technologically enabled orwellian surveillance police state this is what were seeing and then what is more troubling is the party effort to export it authoritarian mercantilist model through number of strategy that aim to create servile relationship with country and then ultimately through economic mean a a the growth in the people liberation army capability to establish area of privacy across the pacific region that exclude the united_state and then it challenged the united_state in the free world globally if china succeeds mean our world be le free le prosperous and le safe so the stake are high and it past for u to recognize the to compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form of aggression that the party engaged in michael_morrell what would an effective china strategy look like to you gen_mcmaster the trump administration if it get credit for anything should get credit for fundamental shift in our policy toward china that wa overdue and that is fundamentally sound and this is the idea that we have to compete and it wa under the strategy of of cooperation and engagement that the chinese communist_party wa emboldened competition doesnt to lead to confrontation in fact quite the opposite and we have returned to arena of competition involving countering more effectively china campaign of sustained industrial espionage against u countering range of china unfair trade and economic practice doing so in large measure through effective international cooperation for example establishing better standard for infrastructure investment internationally the law_enforcement action and investigation that have gone on against apt the main hacking arm of the chinese communist_party have been very effective a combined with sanction and other action against the aggressive arm of the party but really the most important thing for u to do and argue this in chapter battleground entitled turning weakness into strength is to what the chinese communist_party see a source of weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strength what doe the party fear the party fear that the people the chinese people might want to have in how theyre governed so we should strengthen our democratic process the party fear rule of law we should strengthen rule of law in the united_state and with country that are working to strengthen rule of law in their country the party fear freedom of press freedom of the expression we to strengthen our authoritative source of information and recognize that investigative journalism is great counter to some of these pernicious strategy that the party are pursuing so that of it is defensive but of it is more introspective and trying to maintain our competitive advantage michael_morrell this is intelligence matter im michael_morrell were talking with former national_security adviser mcmaster so how do you about gen_mcmaster is significant threat to u because putin again is examining the assumption of previous policy putin is not going to become like the grinch on christmas eve right his heart is not going to get too big a the size get bigger and he not going to decide ok maybe the future of doe lie more with the west and treat the united_state and europe and others differently putin is driven by sense of honor lost after the breakup of the soviet_union he is also driven by this associated desire to restore to national greatness he also cognizant though of the fact that he cannot compete with this on our own term and so what his theory of victory is is to drag u all down and then to be the last man standing and the mean that he using to do this describe the chinese approach of cooption coercion and concealment and alliteration in the chapter a it is campaign of disruption disinformation and denial to try to disrupt u to disrupt our effective governance to disrupt u economically and to economic coercion when he can such a he ha done in europe effectively to and with energy dependence then to deny his most egregious act especially the sustained campaign of cyber enabled information warfare against u which is designed to polarize u to pit u against each_other to reduce our confidence in who we are a people and in our democratic institution and principle and process is dangerous threat for for these reason and the best way to counter the step is to pull the curtain back on this activity to educate ourselves about it to be le susceptible to information to not be our own worst enemy a both political party in instance have because they compromise and they compromised our principle to score some partisan political point and in doing so themselves vulnerable to disinformation and propaganda michael_morrell then what about raising the cost to him of doing this is that an option here in term of deterring him gen_mcmaster absolutely this is what advocated for in battleground is that we have to impose cost on the kremlin on putin that exceed those that he factor in at the beginning of his decision making process it wa my last really in an oval office meeting it wa the that president trump decided to impose significant cost on in response to the attempted poisoning murder of sergei skripal and his daughter with with banned military grade nerve agent and an act that put thousand of uk citizen at risk and it wa at that on that occasion that we expelled you over undeclared intelligence agent that hit putin where it matter because these are agent that were critical to his sustained campaign of subversion against u and we impose significant cost additional cost on through sanction and other action the closing of the san francisco consulate a you michael wa major intelligence collection platform for the russian here in silicon valley and the bay area so that wa significant and that sent strong message after navalnys poisoning id like to see u do the same thing you and a he infiltrating more little green men into belarus and a he continues to enable the serial episode of mass homicide that is the syrian civil war to support hawthorne way perpetuating violence in libya michael_morrell im michael morell were talking with mcmaster former national_security adviser to president trump and author of the just published book by the way if you missed any of today show you can listen to it a podcast just search wherever you get your podcasts let talk about north_korea give u your sense on north_korea gen_mcmaster thanks michael of course it important for u to recognize going in right that north_korea is the only communist hereditary dictatorship in the world and it is the nature of the kim family regime that we have to into account when were considering the danger that the regime pose to the world if it doe posse the most destructive weapon on earth the kim family regime is driven mainly by this drive to remain in power it is of course known a the hermit kingdom it is gulag state that fear any kind of opening to the world and it is regime that across three generation of dictator ha been committed to unifying the korean peninsula under the so called red banner and a we look at north_korea pursuit of the most destructive weapon on earth we have to be at_least open to the possibility that it want those weapon to coerce the united_state off the peninsula a the step in the forcible reunification of the peninsula and of course that would that would be the form of destructive war gen_mcmaster it also important for u to recognize that it is highly unlikely that north_korea want nuclear weapon just to deter u north_korea already had very significant deterrence capability with it conventional weapon and the fact that it so thousand of artillery piece are within the range of of seoul south korea and then also it important to recognize that every act of aggression on the korean peninsula since the north invaded the south in june of ha been initiated by the north the other aspect of this problem michael that is very important to consider is that if north_korea get the weapon is recognized a a nuclear power like who doesnt get after that right this japan start to have conversation with south korea by the way north_korea never met weapon it didnt try to sell to somebody excluding it nuclear program until the israeli defense force bombed that facility in so it very dangerous it dangerous a because of the ideology that drive this regime it warped ideology this is the zushi ideology which ha turned deprivation into sign of virtue and racial superiority and the north korean people have gone through generation of brainwashing so this is big problem michael that the approach that is in place the strategy of maximum pressure it the best course of action we have to test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince kim jong un that he is safer without the weapon than he is with them it be important for whoever is sworn in on january th that they recognize that we should not repeat the failed pattern of previous effort not allow north_korea to draw u into negotiation with an act of aggression and with the demand of big payoff up front just for the privilege of talking with them to not again engage in drawn out negotiation that delivers weak agreement that he immediately break again michael_morrell youve something here that is really important because the conventional wisdom is that he want these weapon for deterrence right that he worried about u attacking him but youre arguing that it more than that that this get to the heart of what north_korea ha always wanted which is to reunify the peninsula which is really important point here that change how you about how you have to deal with him gen_mcmaster this is an argument michael for strategic empathy right to view these complex challenge the perspective of the other and unless you do that youre susceptible to mirror imaging and of course my research for the book you that sensitized me to this it wa in the run up to the vietnam war where some of those who were planning the vietnam strategy development the strategy actually referred to the reasonable man theory of english common law and assumed that ho chi minh would respond a the theoretical reasonable man would respond without taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played in driving and constraining the north vietnamese leadership michael_morrell do you at the end of the it possible to convince him that he would be better off that he would be more secure without these weapon gen_mcmaster do it possible and the reason it possible because weve never really put maximum pressure on the north and so we have this opportunity thanks really to the tremendous work by ambassador nikki haley when she wa at the a you michael these security council sanction on north_korea are unprecedented and reach the key though is to enforce them of course the key country that need to enforce them is china and if china doesnt enforce them if china continues to be complicit with illicit financial flow into and out of the country to continue to provide energy and other material to the north that are limited by these sanction then it for u to consider secondary sanction and maybe on chinese financial institution gen_mcmaster a we see the smuggling of coal and the transshipment of coal and oil and fuel that under article the president could article authority to interdict those ship a you michael this is something we cant really talk about there are other mean of putting pressure on the north that we havent done it yet we have to at_least test the thesis because the alternative are so bleak of either accepting north_korea a nuclear power and coping with that threat or war right that would be very costly it worth pursuing michael_morrell we still have more to discus with general mcmaster and be right back with our final segment michael_morrell were back with more intelligence matter im michael_morrell our guest is mcmaster senior_fellow at both stanford university hoover institution and it graduate school of business so sir let me ask you about another tough iran gen_mcmaster on iran what tell the story of in michael is we have to view the problem of iran with fundamental consideration foremost in our mind the is the ideology of the revolution and how that drive iranian leadership and the iranian leadership is the supreme leader and the guardian council and the islamic revolutionary guard corp we have this fantasy that the reformer the republican within iraq are going to prevail they lost the revolutionary are in charge the hardliner are in charge and whenever they put this forward the shop window of minister zarif their foreign minister or president rouhani thats all youre getting is the shop window that ideology is it drive the iranian regime to continue it four decade proxy_war against the great satan the united_state the little satan israel the arab monarchy and the west broadly and so we have to consider the ideology of the regime and and this year proxy_war gen_mcmaster what argue for in the book is to force the iranian regime to choice you can either be treated like normal nation or you can continue to wage this proxy_war to support terrorist organization and keep the middle_east enmeshed in this perpetual state of sectarian civil war the choice is yours and to impose that choice what we should not do is lift the arm embargo to the regime what we should not do is lift any of the sanction in fact we should impose the cost on the regime to constrain the resource they have available to continue their proxy_war against u but then also ultimately maybe to convince the iranian people that they ought to have government in place and im not talking about like regime change but government in place that shift away it permanent hostility to the united_state israel and the west thats the only path that see forward our policy ought to aim to effect that change in the regime permanent hostility and until it doe any agreement with them it cant be trusted and any agreement with them that allows them to escape making that choice like the iran nuclear deal did is to our disadvantage michael_morrell so you dont see the regime changing policy on it own do you that ha to be forced internally by the iranian people is that fair gen_mcmaster michael on iran it important to keep consideration in mind in crafting strategy toward iran of all that it the ideology of the regime that drive their hostile behavior toward u and we have to recognize that it the supreme leader it the guardian council it islamic revolutionary guard corp who are in charge right there wa struggle you across the history of iran since the revolution in between the republican and the revolutionary hey the revolutionary won and and we have to recognize that the second consideration is that this regime ha waged four decade proxy_war against the great satan u the little satan israel the arab monarchy and the west generally we have to craft our strategy in recognition of this regime permanent hostility to u of course the best way to approach it in the title of the chapter in is forcing the regime to choice of either being responsible nation and then being treated a such or suffering the consequence and this is why it very important to keep the arm embargo in place it very important to keep the sanction in place on the regime to in the short term reduce the resource it ha available to wage this proxy_war and in the term hopefully convince the iranian people to demand change in the nature of the government such that it cease a permanent hostility michael_morrell okay islamic extremism it waned bit in the threat but it still there west africa to the middle_east to south asia to southeast asia how do you about that problem term gen_mcmaster the reason that we havent had another attack on the scale of the most devastating terrorist attack in history of september th is our tremendous intelligence professional our diplomat our military who been engaged against this threat jihadist terrorist organization since what im concerned about michael is that these group are more dangerous today than they were maybe on september th and thats because of course those who committed the mass murder attack against u on were the mujahideen alumnus of the resistance to the soviet occupation of afghanistan the al qaida alumnus the isi alumnus the lashkar taiba alumnus are order of magnitude greater and they have access to more and more destructive capability and the reason weve been safe is because weve been engaged and we have this narrative of ending endless war and disengaging what american to is that we are engaged so we can enable others to bear the brunt of this fight mean this disengagement afghanistan is tragedy the way that weve gone about this we should recognize the sacrifice of our longest war and in particular that of our courageous serviceman soldier gave their life for our country our security this year but we have to also recognize that afghan soldier and police die defending the freedom that theyve enjoyed since the defeat of the taliban in removal of the taliban power so that we to sustained argument to the american people for engagement with this problem of jihadist terrorism because if we dont michael go back to remember when we after the embassy bombing we fired few cruise_missile and called it right that didnt work out michael_morrell the last issue want to ask you about is venezuela which you care about my understanding is that when you arrived at the white_house you were going over the issue and you kind of stumbled on venezuela and hey you whats going on there that doesnt look like were paying attention to this talk about venezuela and why it important gen_mcmaster it immensely important because this is humanitarian catastrophe in venezuela it humanitarian catastrophe thats brought on by an authoritarian regime that is denying the venezuelan people in how theyre governed when we looked at the problem and the nature of the maduro regime and the chavista movement we concluded that this wa again corrupt government that is using criminalized patronage network to effect control of it people it us these motorcycle gang and militia to overwhelm any kind of opposition it ended the constitution so we whats should our goal be our goal should be to work with others to work with like minded country to effect restoration of constitutional rule in venezuela and to do that we felt a if we had to pursue three objective of those objective would be to try to strengthen the opposition right to help the opposition come together you saw that with the rise of bolsonaro you who wa really the people you he not member of the caracas polo club for example he somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged so significantly under chavez and maduro gen_mcmaster the second objective would be for the people to be able to attribute their grievance back to the government not to blame the yankee you for example and the third related to that would be to try to galvanize really popular support for restoration of constitutional government the measure we put in place were sound of course they have proven inadequate and we thought that economic sanction would maybe have significant effect but the reason they havent had bigger effect is there huge black market illicit economy thats run by maduro he us that to sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gang of thug who really prevent any real opposition gaining traction but im proud of what we did in this period of we worked very closely with partner especially in the western hemisphere mexico under the foreign minister of the great luis videgaray who wa wonderful partner took leading role in of the work that we did we tryd to get the organization of american state and others to do more but it wa really the community of like minded nation brazil colombia peru panama argentina we worked very closely together on this problem and remain committed to trying to effect restoration of constitutional government in venezuela michael_morrell youve been fantastic with your just want to ask you more question we have couple of minute left so to be quick here michael_morrell the is that in order to deal with all of these problem that youve talked about you we healthy national_security toolkit healthy diplomacy healthy intelligence capability healthy military capability whats your assessment sort of overall of where we are with our national_security toolkit gen_mcmaster were in good shape thanks to the extremely dedicated civil servant and military professional intelligence professional who we have across our government but what is needed more than anything is higher degree of what argue in is strategic competence and thats the ability to integrate the element of national power so that theyre applied in way that are synergistic the whole is greater than the sum of the part at time we get it right but most often we get it wrong and our approach to these complex problem is fragmented it inconsistent it a mentioned you based on flawed assumption about the nature of the problem what would like to see a these day is more of concerted effort to foster multinational cooperation a write in mean none of these problem are solvable by any country so it very important for u to create the right venue for u to come together not only to work on discrete issue or event together but really to about these complex challenge to frame them together and then to apply our competitive advantage between our like minded country so that we do have synergistic effect and and so that we can build better future for generation to come michael_morrell the last question anybody who listened to the podcast up to this point is going to wow that is hard tough list wonder at the end of the if youre optimistic or if you are pessimistic that were going to get this right going forward gen_mcmaster michael im optimistic about it im optimistic about it a we emerge this triple crisis of the pandemic the recession associated with it and the divide in our society laid bare by george floyds murder and the protest and civil unrest that followed it whats great about our democracy is we are self correcting the american people have in how theyre governed they can demand better and the reason wrote is if the american people understand these challenge they demand better foreign_policy our elected leader you our founder knew that our democracy wa going to require continuous nurturing it still true today and believe that we do have significant problem at home but we also have to confront these challenge abroad because we the covid pandemic that problem that develop abroad can only be dealt with at an exorbitant price once they reach our shore so the argument of battleground is an argument for sustained engagement with the world michael_morrell the book is the author is mcmaster general thank_you very for joining u today gen_mcmaster michael thank_you for the privilege of being with you and thanks for your service be in the get the latest breaking news delivered straight to your_inbox copyright cbs interactive inc all right_reserved advertisement_supported by nonfiction when you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site we earn an affiliate commission by by mcmaster on his morning a president trump national_security adviser in mcmaster invited me to drop by his office he had heard that the york time wa getting ready to report on that attempted to sabotage north_korea missile program with cyberstrikes is this the revelation of the modern enigma code he asked the military historian searching for an analogy the world war ii operation to crack german cipher it wa bracing start for what turned out to be wild month effort to devise modern security strategy for president with no experience more interest in cutting deal than designing term strategy and an unwillingness to sit for intelligence briefing le discussion of containing an angry decaying or of year plan to compete with rising china so battleground is at it heart the mcmaster strategic plan that might have come to fruition had he worked for president who wa interested in strategic plan before he walked into the west wing mcmaster wa the closest thing the army had to soldier scholar his book about vietnam wa devastating account of how the united_state had flawed decision making process that wa largely based on self deception in way battleground is the sequel seeking to ask the question of why not whether the united_state at another moment of protest in the street and bitter partisan divide is losing it ability to shape the world but the answer this are different in mcmaster view the key to his argument is that america is suffering what han morgenthau called strategic narcissism or in mcmaster word the tendency to view the world only in relation to the united_state and to assume that the future course of event depends primarily on decision or plan it hard to argue with that premise every president come to office assuming that the world is waiting for direction washington some country are others are looking for power vacuum they can fill each in it own way that been the story of the past decade ha emerged a disrupter knowing that it ha neither the money nor the technology to the united_state on directly china ha become builder why threaten to cut undersea cable a vladimir_putin submarine force doe if you can dominate global communication a rob joyce an official who worked for mcmaster a the white_house cybersecurity coordinator is the hurricane china is climate change mcmaster realized that and devoted of his in the west wing to writing national_security strategy that would reorient the united_state away nearly decade of and toward countering moscow and beijing which he called revisionist power it wa an impressive document unfortunately the president under whose name it wa published aide concede did not read it battleground expands on the written strategy the the white_house ha barely mentioned since it wa published and make strong case for containing pushing back on chinese influence and using american leverage and ally to confront iran and north_korea what washington need mcmaster argues is an integrated approach that recognizes that the old tool that drove saddam hussein out of kuwait in when mcmaster served are pretty useless year later he start with the united_state and europe were ill prepared for toxic combination of disinformation denial dependence and disruptive technology he say recognition that what happened in wa not that america radar wa off it that the radar wa never built fortunately it ha since been pieced together and in the presidential contest everyone facebook to twitter to the united_state cyber_command ha been pushing back disinformation ha been blocked clumsily at_least briefly unfortunately mcmaster bos wa not on board with this approach in mcmaster he note president trump often improving relation with would be good thing not bad thing while succumbing to putin flattery and treating his criminal action with dismissiveness and moral equivalency and of course the repeated reference to the hoax which meant no in the president circle could discus election interference without dreading an eruption triggered by trump fear that the legitimacy of the election wa being questioned mcmaster never deal head on with the fundamental problem that the administration had on paper defensible strategy and the president kept undermining it instead he cite his top aide fiona hill who he writes always warned that putin seek to divide american and european should not divide themselves china the climate changer is of course immune to containment strategy if the old cold_war wa largely military contest version is military diplomatic economic and technological contest that change led to misappraisal of the challenge a mcmaster point out succession of administration convinced themselves that over china would conform to western built system trump succumbed to different illusion that the chinese were all dealmakers like the property developer he knew crucial to mcmaster analysis is china strategy to wire together it own collection of ally and dependent power selling them controlled in china technology huawei network to after mcmaster departed tiktok addictive app it took the united_state decade and half to understand the immensity of the trojan horse it had let in he say of how the united_state blindly let chinese giant gain ground while american firm exited the market but the reader yearns for mcmaster solution ban chinese technology maybe president trump is trying but then china dominate percent or more of the world network embrace an industrial policy that win back the market it is in dealing with the biggest failure of the trump administration iran and north_korea that mcmaster sound the loudest alarm while he wa major critic of president obama nuclear deal with tehran and criticizes obama aide for overlooking iran support of terrorism and terrorist regime he report that internally he argued for staying inside the deal and using trump threat to toss it aside a leverage but the president wouldn that chess move ahead and dispensed with the whole deal month after mcmaster left he fear that the united_state without ally to confront iran may slip into the place we are with other nuclear power that washington once declared could never posse nuclear arm pakistan provides stark warning iran could become like pakistan today nuclear armed state in which terrorist already enjoy support base the

over in high intensity conflict that according to report by tank rand released last month which explains that political and military leader are already concerned about nato advantage in the air domain worry that is likely to worsen a the number of fifth_generation aircraft grows to the west at heart of texas air show there are seven european nato nation that operate or plan to buy the belgium denmark italy the netherlands and norway poland and uk by those military ought to collectively own more than example of the stealth fighter this exceed the number of u fifth_generation aircraft stationed in the european theater by wide margin say the report the combined force of possessed by european ally is likely to approach aircraft by and would represent roughly percent of the combined fleet for it plan to acquire example of sukhoi su fifth_generation fighter jet by moscow recently the such stealth aircraft would be delivered by december european allied air_force have around fourth_generation fighter comprising type such a the dassault rafale eurofighter typhoon and lockheed martin the combined force currently ha le than fielded according to rand those fourth_generation aircraft would be vulnerable in high intensity conflict against country with robust surface to air missile defence during the opening phase of conflict with vulnerability to advanced ground based threat would constrain the role of most fourth_generation and so called fourth_generation plus platform say the report a a an extensive integrated air defence threat persisted more advanced platform such a the rafale or eurofighter could theoretically perform strike mission inside the threat zone in conjunction with fifth_generation platform although this approach could yield unacceptable attrition but with fourth_generation fighter likely still to up of european nato air_force by the alliance need to find way to better of the aircraft the fast jet could be used to launch range missile strike beyond the range of surface to air missile and if upgraded with active electronically scanned array aesa radar european fourth_generation fighter would be more capable on defence aesa radar can detect track and identify more target faster and at longer distance note rand the resultant situational awareness and ability to defeat multiple threat at the same make an aesa capability essential for aspect of high intensity operation for example to intercept cruise_missile say the tank report the french decision to procure aesa for the rafale fighter is informed by the opportunity to provide increase in detection range of low observable target and maximize the value of weapon system such a the meteor beyond visual range missile the mbda meteor is an active radar guided beyond visual range air to air missile that is reported to have reach of nm km in theory if fourth_generation fighter like the rafale ha an aesa radar and is armed with beyond visual range missile like the meteor it ought to be able to see and hit incoming aircraft while staying out of reach itself however beside the addition of aesa on the rafales other european fourth_generation aircraft lack the advanced radar uncertainty remain a to which nation invest in aesa radar technology advanced and range munition and secure communication link among other important capability say rand the degree to which european air_force acquire these technology directly impact their ability to contribute to the range of combat air mission expected in high intensity conflict for it the uk royal air_force announced in september plan to add the ecrs mk aesa radar to example of it tranche production standard typhoon with initial operational capability targeted for ultimately to the most of mixed fleet of fourth and fifth_generation aircraft nato to invest in communication technology to link the jet a a training exercise to practice coordinating the combat aircraft can communicate among themselves with their multifunction advanced data link madl low probability of intercept communication link rand point to fourth and fifth_generation fighter operating concept called combat intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr mode described by justin bronk of the royal united service institute tank in the combat isr mode four ship flight of connected by madl generates situational awareness and share targeting data with legacy platform that can then fire their payload outside the range of the most capable of the enemy air defence explains rand the fourth and fifth_generation combat aircraft would communicate and pas targeting information with the link system add the report however this might be vulnerability point it is reasonable to assume that the military would seek to disrupt this synergy during conflict particularly in light of recent investment in ew capability rand say still european nato military are getting more practice with the already ally have undertaken initial step to establish common tactic technique and procedure for incorporating fifth_generation asset into combined operation through targeted exercise a a preliminary synthetic training system that link fourth and fifth_generation aircraft the tank say of the highest hurdle to nato collaboration might be investment in aircraft readiness to be operationally relevant during theatre conflict nato air_force must maintain sufficient number of available aircraft munition and aircrew say rand currently most european air_force maintain around half of their existing fleet or le at mission capable status with some ally falling below that mark what more fourth_generation aircraft are suffering rising maintenance cost platform age operational wear and tear resulting high operational tempo and challenge associated with spare part pipeline serve a significant constraint to aircraft availability say the report the also ha teething problem it autonomic logistics information system support system that is so troubled that it ha to be replaced across the worldwide fleet rand recommends number of solution to nato aircraft readiness problem making public data on mission capable rate it also suggests public agreement by nato leader on standard availability objective could provide renewed political and budgetary focus on efficient and adequately funded maintenance and sustainment ultimately rand concludes that the growing number of stealth aircraft in europe mean the trend line lead in the right direction with additional budgetary and policy attention to increasing readiness european ally have the opportunity to significantly enhance combat airpower over the coming decade say the tank the dod had expressed confidence a recently a august that iot would be complete by march after

although the draft resolution have been circulated among un member state neither are yet final nor public the proposed resolution call on state to wait until the current group of governmental expert gge and oewg meeting are completed in early before formally proposing process to address cyber issue at the un in contrast the draft resolution call for oewg to be convened despite the fact that the

oewg raise doubt a to whether the call for poa can achieve consensus support which it need in order to be endorsed in the final oewg report if so the poa could potentially be put to the un general assembly a resolution later on perhaps incorporated into future resolution in this case the poa initially pitched to eliminate the redundancy of the parallel un cyber process could simply emerge a

trial while simultaneously offering the vaccine to frontline medic and teacher jumping the gun carry potentially deadly consequence renewed spread of the virus if weakly effective vaccine lull people into complacency on mask wearing and physical distancing before herd immunity ha been established in the united_state the vaccine that are likely to be candidate for emergency authorization by the food and drug administration are at_least partly through phase three testing of course sputnik may turn out to work just fine ha plenty of world class scientist and the gamaleya institute claim to have had the institute point to it development of an ebola vaccine and say sputnik is just slightly modified version of it vaccine for middle_east respiratory syndrome there no evidence though that those vaccine have actually been deployed in significant way anywhere in the world the scramble by country to secure potential coronavirus vaccine is looking lot like replay of what happened in the with antiretrovirals to combat aid and in with the influenza vaccine wealthy nation are buying up the initial supply most likely leaving only leftover for the rest of the world later if at all the united_state for example ha secured advance purchase commitment for over million dos of at_least six candidate vaccine all for itself compounding an image of selfishness the trump administration confirmed last month that it would not join an effort by dozen of country to provide for the pooled procurement and equitable distribution of vaccine this decision ha created the political space for to cultivate the role of benefactor though it too ha not joined the covax effort is pitching dozen of country licensing and production offer for sputnik these deal aren limited to obvious friend and neighbor like and pending regulatory approval at_least million dos and more buy million and mexico ha purchase agreement for all told is claiming preliminary application totaling we don yet the term of these arrangement and the pending regulatory approval clause is important the deal might break down if sputnik safety and efficacy don pan out though is trying to quell these fear by for adverse reaction if you the head of mexico or the philippine or brazil reeling month of medical social and economic shock you might be willing to your chance on an incompletely tested and probably relatively cheap product that you can get your hand on soon especially if it look like the united_state and europe are leaving you to go it alone mr putin only rival for the role of global savior is which is also rushing across regulatory milestone for vaccine and pushing deal like to help latin american and caribbean country pay for them china ha also just joined covax though the kremlin is engaged in pandemic related belt tightening just like everyone else it carrying little debt and ha billion in liquid asset in it sovereign wealth fund it can afford some measure of vaccine generosity the image burnishing would be worth the price sputnik is also fodder for disinformation campaign on state controlled medium the claim is that only the vaccine is safe and effective ha history dating back to soviet time of health related disinformation the kgb planted fake_news story around the world in the early wa an american biological weapon research ha shown that troll and bot have actively tried to in vaccine in the united_state since at_least for the sputnik vaccine go far beyond national pride mr putin need showy win after slew of recent bad press he resorting to his standard playbook leveraging weak hand and exploiting misstep and vulnerability unilateralism neglect or abandonment of key ally retreat established science to bolster image and global position a great power is betting that it short term diplomatic gain outweigh the longer term reputational risk should problem arise with the sputnik vaccine the united_state could counter gambit and contribute to an important global public good by making relatively modest investment in the covax vaccine effort do we really want to cede this ground to mr putin is professor of political science at virginia commonwealth university specializing in global health with focus on and eurasia advertisement regardless of the election result moscow continue to see u policy a provisional a of temporary phase that need to wait out to see what follows in early the european council on foreign relation organised discussion on in washington with the intention of comparing european and american view on the country and finding out whether there wa transatlantic rift in our approach and indeed there wa rift but it wa not transatlantic instead it ran between participant european a a american who that must be pressured into accepting the rule based world order and others who asked what rule based order where do you see it this rift become more pronounced and acquire importance should joe_biden win the u presidential_election his victory would almost certainly lead to renewed attempt to engage in transatlantic cooperation on several policy area or maybe starting with but while modicum of transatlantic unity and coordination would undoubtedly be good the vision that guide it matter great deal any transatlantic policy need to be based on reality attempt to recreate the past to restore the international order of the or that of would likely prove not just futile but in chaotic world where order is not yet available need to tread carefully and avoid overplaying weakened hand while still quietly working on the contour of the future europe ha three competing theory on how to approach but all of them are rendered ineffective by the absence of global order to give them structure the difficulty of coming up with workable approach to is reflected in europe policy these day europe ha three competing theory on how to approach but all of them are rendered ineffective by the absence of global order to give them structure the let call it the lithuanian theory to reflect the country recent activism on belarus though it is shared by in northern and eastern europe consists of doubling down on the moral high ground rooted in the end of history thinking of the this policy seek to influence through criticism it emphasis conditionality treat dialogue a reward and resort to symbolic act such a public display of solidarity with pro democracy force and of course crafted speech competing with it is the french theory embodied by president emmanuel macron attempt at outreach to this is rooted in classical realpolitik balancing the notion that to avoid being crushed between the united_state and china europe need to engage in some rapprochement with regardless of our normative difference and moscow weak democratic credential in to politics this view is expressed in effort to come round to europe or sometimes just france position and lingering somewhat sadly on the sideline there is the german theory rooted in what academic would label liberal interdependence and confirmed by germany experience of unification this theory assumes that cooperation and dialogue eliminate difference and lead to normative convergence germany theory wa dealt an early blow in when vladimir_putin return to the presidency showed that normative convergence had not happened and it largely crashed after invasion of ukraine in still up until last summer germany ha been looking for topic on which it could engage with in the hope that keeping the line of communication open would have some good effect and help the world safer place none of these approach ha worked recently this is because in world in flux moscow see them all a fleeting theoretical construct that are not fit to invest in let alone build on policymakers dismiss the lithuanian theory a fantasy based on past dream moscow doe not believe in the normative framework that form it basis and if it did would fight against it the french theory go nowhere because moscow doe understand who macron speaks for himself france or europe moscow see his idea a unrealistic and domestically driven and in any case ha no intention of limiting it freedom of action by prematurely siding with europe especially given that it doe not whether the european union become policy actor to reckon with or if it is here to stay scepticism about europe may also explain the dismal fate of the german theory moscow ha recently allowed it dispute with berlin to pile up in way that may cost it it best european friend apparently just because it doe not care to save or invest in relationship with germany and by implication europe the u election result affect the relative standing of these theory biden win might embolden the lithuanian theory put the french theory on the defensive and depending on the circumstance lend energy to germany attempt to create patch of common ground in the west otherwise normatively adversarial relationship with not to be confused with appeasement which is different thing entirely proponent of each theory would seek to strengthen it by coordinating and cooperating with biden administration and they would want to help the president succeed using their favoured approach which would be different trump but so moscow would likely remain reluctant to buy into any of this this is not to that it doe not matter to who win the u election moscow doe not have great expectation regarding either president but the outcome nonetheless have an impact on view on the direction the world is heading in second trump presidency would validate what according to some expert ha always been putin world view instinctively he is nationalist unilateralist and transactional analyst in december for him this is how the world work and he want to be vindicated he want to be able to tell the west he ha always been right biden win would clash with this view it would show the kremlin that the normative idea that have underpinned the western policy are not dead that they might comeback and importantly adapt to reality but adaptation cannot be taken for granted and would inevitably so in either case moscow continue to see u policy a provisional a of temporary phase that need to wait out to see what follows moscow would view trump a destroyer of the liberal system and would welcome this but not a an architect of system that it could engage with and moscow would inevitably suspect biden presidency of being just the last gasp of the former liberal consensus the more biden urged restoration of obama era policy not to mention those of the clinton era the more moscow would see his action a the death throe of dying order and a such something to resist or ignore conversely the stronger biden proved in acknowledging that the world had changed and that western policy needed to change too the more seriously moscow would him a figure who could shape the future the task is to find way of shaping the world influencing in the circumstance where the western unipolar moment of the ha passed and year of relative western hegemony might be drawing to close this take humility caution and clear head emotionally driven policy and rushed solution do not fit in seminal study exploring the lesson that the soviet_collapse might offer to the european union ivan krastev that in time of threat of disintegration political actor should bet on flexibility and constrain their natural urge for rigidity and solution intended to last which if and when they fail can accelerate the momentum to disintegration this applies to the disintegration of the international order a attempt to forcefully recreate yesterday order almost certainly lead to it final discreditation effort to build something forcefully and prematurely be stillborn fruitful policy requires humble mindset and an understanding that to shape the world order the west need to start at home by making it own society work by remaking them this but it ha chance

caution a it central bank say there is some wiggle room for further interest rate reduction we see some room for the reduction it is limited it not so a it wa before but we decide how and when to this room according to incoming data central bank chief elvira nabiullina told cnbc geoff cutmore on wednesday referring to the country interest rate in both it september and october meeting russia central bank chose to keep it key rate steady at total reduction of basis point since june of the previous year nabiullinas emphasis wa on being cautious she we made pause in september and october assessing the short term inflationary risk and some risk related to financial stability the market that why we we should be more careful about the development of the situation with the pandemic with geopolitical issue and other issue nabiullina still considers the bias in interest rate to be to the downside if she is being cautious because the covid escalation in autumn increase the disinflationary risk and the risk for the demand and we see that in medium term perspective the disinflationary risk prevail of course she and we that our policy remain through the end of next year we that instead of decision of cutting rate that we have made before it last through the end of this year at_least nabiullina recovery for economy in the third quarter wa very dynamic and led by domestic good consumption but the resurgence of coronavirus case in of the world ha forced the country to revise down it forecast for consumer and investor demand key of that lie in demand for of most lucrative export oil which saw historic drop this spring and is still trading at more than below pre pandemic level due to weak demand the autumn covid escalation ha led to some slowdown in the recovery and that is why we revised our forecast for this year only plus half percentage point and we expect this year the economy contract by between and nabiullina that figure is still not a bad a that of the world bank which say that economy could contract by for we brought down our forecast for the next year we the growth be between and and be led by the internal consumption she the world

campaign chairman with an associate suspected of tie to intelligence another trump associate sought inside information about the candidate himself for his opponent email then tried once he entered the white_house these were among the finding of the special counsel investigation of tie between and trump campaign it produced trove of damaging or at_least embarrassing information about trump yet in the campaign democrat are largely ignoring the probe it republican who are making it top campaign issue trump and his supporter have cast the investigation a witch hunt it refrain in trump tweet and speech and on conservative medium in the run up to the election trump appointed official are ordering the of document that trump hope boost his campaign while some of the revelation the steady drip of newly declassified document are serious they do not undercut the reason the probe wa launched or it principal finding an inspector general and bipartisan senate panel have both concluded that the probe wa valid look at the probe why wa the investigation launched the fbi opened crossfire hurricane on july after learning trump campaign aide may have had advance knowledge that intelligence operative had stolen democratic email diplomat revealed that the aide george papadopoulos had boasted to him that he had heard had damaging information on democrat hillary clinton that it could release to harm her campaign that may conversation triggered alarm within the fbi since the hacking operation which resulted in the public disclosure of thousand of hacked email wa not yet public knowledge what did the investigation find the investigation wa taken over by special counsel robert mueller whose team documented substantial contact between trump associate and that included with lawyer that trump oldest son donald_trump jr took with the expectation of receiving dirt on clinton and campaign chairman paul manafort who shared internal polling data with contact whom characterized a intelligence officer separate justice department inspector general report wa opened for valid reason and did not find evidence of partisan bias the senate committee report found manafort contact posed grave risk wa trump vindicated he wa not criminally charged but he wasn vindicated it is true mueller his investigation did not find sufficient evidence to establish criminal conspiracy between trump or his associate and to sway the election but the investigation also described broad interference a a campaign that wa eager to receive the help and expected to benefit it mueller also investigated multiple episode in which he found trump tried to exert control over the investigation by firing his fbi director but mueller did not push forward with obstruction of justice charge citing justice department policy against indicting sitting president what are the criticism of the investigation most focus on strand the fbi suspicion that former campaign adviser carter page wa agent page ha denied that and wa not charged with any wrongdoing the inspector general identified major error and omission in application the fbi submitted to secretive court for permission to eavesdrop on page for instance the fbi failed to update the court a it received information that undercut it original premise about page it also highlighted how the warrant application relied in on democratic funded research conducted by former british spy christopher steele the problem are significant because they suggest the fbi misused intrusive surveillance power or withheld information the court the fbi wa alerted of research and key source for steele wa himself once investigated by the fbi for possible connection to intelligence newly declassified document show multiple former fbi and justice department official the application had they then what they fbi director chris wray ha issued to prevent the problem recurring but the page aspect of the probe accounted for only fraction of it and the dossier though the target of derision had nothing to do with the decision to open the investigation the page problem don relate to the criminal conviction that mueller team produced against six trump associate or the russian indicted on charge related to election interference how are republican weaponizing it in an extraordinary mix of politics in america national_security apparatus trump ha demanded that intelligence and justice department official act to discredit the investigation before the nov election to large extent they ve complied of the declassified material involves page and the dossier but they ve also released information that while creating buzz in conservative medium offer scant evidence of wrongdoing official declassified the name of obama administration official of an american in this case former national_security adviser michael flynn who surveillance revealed had interacted with ambassador but who wasn identified by name in intelligence report while trump cast the unmasking a sinister it routine action and proper procedure were followed the washington post reported tuesday that probe commissioned by barr and focused on the unmasking question had concluded without criminal charge or any finding of substantive wrongdoing separately some republican senator are seeking an inspector general investigation after record showed multiple member of mueller team had forgotten their work phone passcodes or entered the wrong one too often causing data to be lost of the prosecutor andrew weissmann ha in medium interview that the issue is overblown since the information wa backed up more recently the national intelligence director john ratcliffe trump loyalist declassified what he wa intelligence analysis though he acknowledged the information might not be accurate meanwhile attorney general william barr ha appointed prosecutor to investigate the origin of the probe that prosecutor attorney john durham of connecticut ha former fbi lawyer for altering an email related to page surveillance trump ha demanded big name indictment and called for the probe to be but it not clear when durham finish his work or what it reveal how is the probe figuring in the presidential campaign before it wa released the mueller report wa seen a potentially devastating to trump with it detail about campaign tie to and the president effort to hinder the probe yet democrat have hardly mentioned it leading in the poll democratic nominee joe_biden ha focused instead on trump handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the divisiveness of his presidency issue that may be more likely to resonate with voter meanwhile attacking the probe is core of trump campaign trump and his supporter have often the investigation with trump falsely claiming that president barack_obama spied on his campaign vice_president mike penny falsely suggested at debate last week that the investigation had vindicated trump those attack on the probe may not win over undecided voter but they could energize trump base at when the campaign need strong turnout in crucial battleground state moscow president_vladimir putin thursday there is no for china military alliance but noted it could be forged in the future putin statement signaled deepening tie between moscow and beijing amid the leader also made strong call for extending the last remaining arm_control pact between moscow and washington asked during video conference with international foreign_policy expert thursday whether military union between moscow and beijing wa possible putin replied that we don it but theoretically it quite possible to imagine it perceive any ballistic missile launched at it territory a nuclear attack that warrant nuclear retaliation the military warned in an article published friday and china have hailed their strategic_partnership but so far rejected any talk about the possibility of their forming military alliance putin pointed to the war game that the armed force of china and held a signal of the country burgeoning military cooperation putin also noted that ha shared sensitive military technology that helped significantly boost china military potential but didn mention any specific saying the information wa sensitive without any doubt our cooperation with china is bolstering the defense capability of china army he adding that the future could see

of ukraine crimea accusation of meddling in the presidential_election and other rift host of scenario could push china and the united_state into some kind of conflict putin on thursday emphasized the importance of extending that expires in february last arm_control pact with the united_state earlier this week the united_state and signaled their readiness to accept compromise to salvage the start treaty just week ahead of the presidential_election in which president donald_trump face strong challenge former vice_president joe_biden whose campaign ha accused trump of being soft on start wa signed in by then president barack_obama and then president dmitry medvedev the pact limit each country to no more than deployed nuclear warhead and deployed missile and bomber and envisages sweeping on site inspection to verify compliance had offered to extend the pact without any condition while the trump administration initially insisted that it could only be renewed if china agreed to join china ha refused to consider the idea the recently modified it stance and proposed year extension of the treaty but it must be coupled with the imposition of broader cap on nuclear warhead the kremlin initially resisted washington demand but it position shifted this week with the foreign ministry stating that moscow can accept freeze on warhead if the agrees to put forward no additional demand putin didn address the issue of the freeze on warhead but he emphasized the importance of salvaging start the question is whether to keep the existing treaty a it is begin detailed discussion and try to reach compromise in year or lose that treaty altogether leaving ourselves and the united_state along with the rest of the world without any agreement restricting an arm race he believe the second option is worse at the same he added that wasn clinging to the treaty and ensure it security without it he pointed at and indicated readiness to include them in future pact if our partner decide that they don it so be it we can stop them he security not be hurt particularly because we have the most advanced weapon system the successful test launch of the zircon hypersonic cruise_missile come on

the that you not find anywhere else in the world bolshoy deviatinsky pereulok no moscow federation phone fax so mr ambassador a you mentioned the for the last month wa unusual so frustration for people so bad news and culture ha always been good retreat for people to boost up their energy morale spirit and everything so very happy to talk to you about cultural positive aspect of your activity and american relation so please tell u about the initiative regarding the hermitage foundation and hermitage state museum thank_you konstantin it pleasure to be talking about something is a exciting and a important a this program have to we were talking at the outset about how covid ha impacted the world since we last saw each_other at the beginning of this year in january among other thing it prevented me going to st_petersburg in my or month a ambassador which wa looking forward to haven been there since and wa looking forward to visiting the hermitage among other thing so you ve referenced this grant that we ve made through the ambassador fund for cultural preservation to support the hermitage and can give you little bit little bit of detail on that the project is actually partnership among four organization there this ambassador fund for cultural preservation which is of the state department bureau of educational and cultural affair that and then there our role at the embassy and you mentioned the hermitage foundation which is based in york city and then finally there the state hermitage museum in st_petersburg and among all four of these these organization we came together to come up with project to restore three fresco of the raphael school a of the commemoration of the th anniversary of the death of raphael and that what we focused on these fresco were painted between and on the wall of villa in italy and they were actually acquired by the hermitage in but over the past year the fresco have suffered considerable exposure to the element and prior restoration effort were imperfect so the program that we sponsoring is to restore those fresco which is urgently needed and a it done in connection with the th anniversary of raphael death and we hopeful that after they restored that there be really an unveiling of the true beauty of the fresco not just to the public but to the world which is you the hermitage museum is of course cultural treasure of but really of the world mean the hermitage is such literally treasure of art and culture so with this grant we doing the program is done we ve been working with the executive director of the hermitage foundation and want to credit her saranna biel cohen working on behalf of the foundation and of course the director of the hermitage museum mikhail piotrovsky want to credit them for their hard work on this project and next week on october the foundation the museum and myself the embassy have virtual launch of the project and anybody any of your reader or you if you interested it ll be at pm on wednesday the th and we ll learn more about the fresco how they ll be restored and the cultural significance very good and could you couple of word about this ambassador fund for cultural preservation a understand it is deliberate foundation to preserve treasure cultural treasure throughout the world yes indeed it wa established nineteen year_ago in it program that operated in over country and it managed out of the state department in washington and there is process to review proposal and get approval the department of state to provide the funding so this program that we submitted on behalf of the hermitage foundation and the hermitage wa in competition against hundred of other proposal other embassy worldwide and the fact that this project won this grant is sign both of the significance of the project itself and of the cultural partnership between the united_state and and this be the seventh project that we have funded in over the last year or so so it an important sign of the cultural bond between the united_state and very good you lucky that you prepared the good paper and we are lucky of course russian that this be restored and may ask you some question about other cultural people to people so to relation between and america like sister_city program or the business cooperation or cooperation in space arctic because there are lot of dimension of coexistence rather only all the military and strategic one konstantin you absolutely right and would you there are relation between the government and the government of the federation whether it on strategic and military issue political issue and we all how fraught those relation have been over the last several year in particular but there broader relationship between the united_state and between our people cultural and educational exchange in business in space in the arctic and small topic that like to emphasize but my colleague here at the embassy are probably sick of hearing me talk about ice hockey which is personal interest of mine but it those connection konstantin that are among the most significant that we have and they are bond that keep u together when the political situation seems most dire and thing ve observed in my tenure here is how the relationship between the united_state and ha changed just in my professional lifetime you came mentioned earlier in our conversation that visited st_petersburg in wa private citizen had great interest in and history visited moscow what wa then leningrad but visited the soviet_union then and visited leningrad not st_petersburg and if you of all that happened in our relationship between our country over the last to year how thing have changed the ups and down what grown ha been the cultural business all of those tie between our people that have grown dramatically and that distinguishes this era that sort of late soviet_era that grew up in in the and when we didn have those tie that keep u together when the political sea get choppy so for example we have more than business invested in doing business here in and that mean russian and american working together it not just the bolshoi traveling to york and performing in york city or you an equivalent theatre company coming the united_state and performing here it is to personal interaction between colleague in business and that significant and it provides little more ballast for the relationship when a the political sea can get choppy but a those of u who are old enough with some perspective can look back over the last three or four decade and see how our relationship ha changed our counterpart or year the ambassador and your successor you sure they ll be remarking too on how thing have changed since and the relationship between the united_state and remember those dark old day with you with ukraine crimea and syria and libya and nagorno_karabakh and belarus and election interference and cyber this and god know what our successor are going to be talking about year but what is the fact that we have made the connection that we ve made over the last or year in business in the art in sport and entertainment it more likely that it positive outcome and more positive development not just focused on the to negativity yeah you mentioned the amazing figure that thousand business are dealing with despite all the sanction and all the risk connected with sanction and our cooperation between military in syria also exist and they exchange information so really share your view that the infrastructure of sphere of interrelation is good support to these big politics and of that you absolutely right of that infrastructure is something you mentioned konstantin sister_city partnership we ve got large number this is program that been in existence for decade established by and managed by the government so there an official government relationship that involved here note sister_city international is nonpartisan nonprofit which serf a the national membership organization for individual sister_city county and state across the united_state sister_city international wa created at president eisenhower white_house summit on citizen diplomacy but it is an independent nongovernmental organization end note but these sister_city relationship you date back into soviet time into the when the five sister_city relationship happened and you we ve got city all across the united_state that are joined with city across so sarasota florida and vladimir for example burlington vermont and yaroslavl louisville kentucky and perm chicago and moscow and it you it small thing but it an important of our relationship and also the link with business a konstantin because what we ve done here at the embassy and my colleague at the department of commerce and our counterpart at the ministry of trade is that we have made connection business to business connection with region and city in the united_state because of covid we had to do this virtually but we were planning trade mission texas texas company and the government of the state of texas to the yekaterinburg in the ural region we had to do it because of covid we did it virtually but it wa full event the government of the state of texas wa involved the governor of the state himself and making those type of regional connection for business is is profitable way forward and ve spoken to secretary ross our secretary of commerce about this and that the secretary himself had phone call recently with trade minister manturov and that an area where we going to continue to pursue making those connection regionally a not just government to government very important because lot of asymmetric information is available in region people want to do something but they lack adequate information so thank_you for that effort in yekaterinburg because it our industrial number three or number four city in do you have any plan for cooperation in the arctic because arctic seems to attract attention yes it very relevant and timely topic in our relationship konstantin because a you over the chair of the arctic council in just few month in and the arctic council is very important institution that promotes this vital region a zone of cooperation free conflict and the council itself is an institution where we can discus sustainable development the environment protection and development of indigenous people and it shared interest of the united_state of course ha huge chunk of the arctic region within it northern border but the united_state canada the other member of the country that border the arctic region we all have shared interest in it development and it protection and so my colleague in washington and our embassy here have been engaged directly with the government with the ministry of foreign affair in particular met with deputy foreign minister titov couple of month ago to talk about arctic cooperation and role assuming the chair of the arctic council and those discussion have continued between our government between washington and moscow and the pace of interaction increase a we get closer to when doe assume the chair okay thank_you and the last question but our younger audience is always interested about student exchange and with covid lot of zoom class may have but still what is number of russian which are enrolled in american university and college terrific question and could guess off the top of my head but what going to propose is that we get back to you with the precise figure for your publication note the latest open door report show that for the academic year more than russian studied in the u we do not have the figure for current enrollment in online program end note but what would offer konstantin is we had participated in virtual program that the united_state government that we the embassy helped organize we usually do it in person we bring over representative college and university in the united_state and they come here to to moscow to other city and they available to family student parent who are interested in having student study in the united_state because of covid we weren able to do that in person we did it virtually but here the benefit though of that if there silver lining we got more college and university able to participate virtually who wouldn have been able to to send either afford to or couldn send somebody to participate in program in in moscow so what that meant wa that the student and their family that were interested and participated got wide variety of wider variety of college and university presented and interested in recruiting them to study in the united_state and you yourself studied at penn won embarrass you by saying how year_ago it wa but wa out of college myself by then so we neither of u is youngster anymore but you yourself can testify to the benefit of study abroad and getting to another country and seeing how their education system work and number of my colleague here at the embassy have studied at institution language culture so it key component and ha been for and we really looking to to encourage that and it always fun to meet russian who have studied in the united_state and compare note about their experience with our expectation and these were these were my remark and wasn just trying to flatter the participant it fact that we hear u college and university that student are among the most desired are the most serious hardworking and just great addition to the student body which isn this surprise for those of u who or aspire to to it an important of our relationship the broader relationship between our people and we certainly want to encourage it and we doing all we can in the face of the covid pandemic to sure that those relationship continue and that they don wither or diminish just because we not able to have in person interaction so my hope is that we ll have large number of student traveling to the united_state and enriching our school and our campus a you did in the in philadelphia thank_you and personally am very grateful to you for supporting this student exchange because you if you live in the country it is so difficult to influence you in pushing any misperceptions to engage you in witch hunt and it help to understand the nature of people and since year_ago returned back philadelphia you keep this interest towards america read every american paper read american book watch american television watched the debate tonight put down note who what what is the argument of that and this is something very profound in our sympathy and relation and desire to improve it because belong to that of society and always openly at every level that we believe that good relation with america can benefit people in medicine in science in culture in sport in engineering in business benefit it it could be rather selfish this point of view but it is beneficial it not hostile and wish that you in your position of ambassador put all your effort pursue the line in these dark dark day of covid and the distraction of regular relationship oh you so right and had great experience few month ago and can add to all of the category you listed law and the legal profession so spoke to law student it wa probably couple of hundred it wa virtual virtual event did it by zoom or some other electronic mean which my colleague are better able to describe and function than just sit in front of the camera and talk but what wa fascinating wa for of those student wa the american that they really had chance to engage with in their young life and we had lot in common we talked about our legal education some of their professor were on the call and we got to share few comment about law professor and what it wa like joining profession what their expectation were and it just an example in our life we ve both experienced this russian and american there are so thing that we have in common whether we engineer or ballet dancer or hockey player or author or lawyer people are people and the more that we can have these exchange trade experience explore how our system are different and how they similar it break down stereotype and it just make thing between our country make the relationship stronger and make it more difficult for political wind to blow the relationship in really dangerous direction the more we understand each_other the better we ll be able to overcome some of these difference which would separate u yeah thank_you mr ambassador do you what noticed that what you talked today wa actually about the substance of american relation because usually lot of expert view the of to america and vice versa only a mean to solve some others country problem like we to solve problem in north_korea or in iran or in afghanistan or it here but it never table which belongs to u all sphere which you mentioned just belong to and america in every aspect and it is most valuable in this relation that we

amount of my focused on and you write about and we all interested in and they extremely important to the world and global security and peace and prosperity but if we talking about the united_state and it not just those issue and our relationship ha history wa joking with the deputy foreign minister titov we were we were talking about the arctic and commented on the fact that have to thank then the empire for giving the united_state stake in the arctic by selling u alaska right so our relationship go back way to when secretary of state seward purchased alaska and made u of eventually the arctic council but we shared laugh over that but it just an example of over the united_state and we have to deal with each_other on these political issue but on broader level people to people we have stronger tie than we did when wa growing up in the and and people to people tie educational and so forth the political issue are a challenging and maybe more challenging in some way than they were for my predecessor or year_ago when it wa the soviet_union versus the west and the united_state but in any event a a we keep talking about positive thing like this it give u more space to try to work out the more difficult political issue a thank_you very for this interview and looking forward to talk with you on some other issue maybe later because there were lot of substantial thing you conveyed it

difficulty borchaly azerbaijani inhabited section georgia georgian azerbaijani relation have been good almost since georgia independence largely thanks reconciliation convenience between soviet_era rival eduard shevardnadze and heydar aliyev aliyev needed georgia enable the western transit azerbaijan hydrocarbon export and the import western good turkey shevardnadze needed azerbaijan secure oil and gas pipeline provide both transit royalty and strategic importance the west also needed aliyev help ensure that the large azerbaijani population georgia reliably voted for shevardnadze political grouping the citizen union georgian armenian relation have been trickier portion the armenian population georgia concentrated javakheti near large soviet later military base that fueled the region economy until closed the javakhk armenian sought independence apparently with encouragement but armenia only transit route and the west lay through georgia the karabakh_conflict had closed armenia border with turkey and azerbaijan the government then armenian president levon ter petrosyan tamped down javakhk separatism relation between the country grew closer after mikheil saakashvili came the presidency georgia and they have remained friendly under subsequent leader this policy the south_caucasus intertwined with the north caucasus which devoted the blood and treasure generation and which post_soviet see key the integrity the state domestic security concern have intruded the south_caucasus number area power ebbed away the end the soviet_era the army for the century no_longer wielded the decisive force the region the turkish third army the most powerful military the region and local adapted the strategic effect threw diminished resource into the caucasus suppress the chechen rebellion and met defeat subsequent the region and demand adapt the conventional armed force europe treaty allow for greater freedom movement the flank stemmed perceived redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence the region address move adapt the treaty azerbaijan and georgia allied with moldova and ukraine form what later solidified into the organization for democracy and economic development known simply the guam ossetians ethno linguistically and religiously different their neighbor have been principal ally the north caucasus for century dealt with host ethnic nationalism the year after the soviet_collapse chechen separatism and later armed islamist movement north ossetia gained strategic importance and leverage with leadership used that leverage ensure robust support for south ossetian separatism georgia likewise other ethnic group the mountain the north caucasus for example the chechen kabardians and cherkes saw abkhaz separatism georgia the validation their own ethnic nationalism with facilitation called volunteer made their way abkhazia join the separatist war against georgia among the most effective these the chechen shamil basayev who later archnemesis the russian but their ally that struggle during the second chechen war fighter and their family took refuge georgia pankisi gorge which effectively outside the georgian government control president boris yeltsin called shevardnadze november demand the reinstatement border troop georgia and passage for military unit through georgia attack pankisi the south shevardnadze stalled and then called the american dissuade yeltsin later after the september terrorist attack the united_state sent troop train the georgian restore security pankisi forestalling action there worse the point view shevardnadze made deal with ruslan gelayev chechen commander sheltering the pankisi gorge launch attack abkhaz held territory the attack failed but the authority viewed this series event proof that georgia treacherous and untrustworthy lastly azerbaijan share border and considerable ethnic overlap with dagestan autonomous republic where salafist proselytizing made extensive inroad the after some year full fledged islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked with the remains the armed chechen nationalist movement which also fell under salafist influence when attack began authority dagestan security cooperation with azerbaijan gained importance for internal security the stage thus set early for consistent static policy toward the south_caucasus economy force balancing act preserve traditional friendship and strategic alliance with armenia without harming economic and security relationship with azerbaijan and constant emotional and ever deepening hostility toward georgia view the international arena series camp each centered power whose greatness confirmed possessing camp been keen ensure that the nation forged out former soviet republic remain camp and formed multinational institution cement those relation initially had hope that the commonwealth independent state formed when the soviet_union broke might fill the bill azerbaijan and armenia joined the inception but not until that georgia president shevardnadze under military pressure support abkhaz separatism and facing rebellion ousted former president gamsakhurdia reluctantly acceded georgia withdrew the after the country defeat the russo georgian war with the having little influence put forward other institution accomplish the task the collective security treaty originally signed became the collective security treaty organization csto designed counterweight nato armenia joined relieve security concern with regard turkey azerbaijan and georgia did not the eurasian custom union officially formed but active onward also included armenia but not azerbaijan georgia turned the custom union into the eurasian economic union eaeu intended mirror image the moscow ongoing attempt equate the organization the international stage had significant effect the caucasus noted later this paper azerbaijan able avoid joining called camp thanks independent oil revenue which have grown for both azerbaijan and other post_soviet caspian littoral state the early moscow ability project power low and could only protest ineffectually when littoral country signed hydrocarbon extraction contract the absence international agreement define national right the caspian azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan brought western energy major without fearing reaction azerbaijan signed major contract the status the caspian not codified preliminarily until and this treaty cover exploitation the seabed could not fight joined settling for sharing the profit hydrocarbon development and transit for the mid the united_state and maneuvered against another through their respective support pipeline the united_state heavily promoted the baku tbilisi ceyhan btc pipeline alternative monopoly hydrocarbon transit the west however doctrine demanded that the pipeline commercially viable own right and the united_state refused put resource into boosting that viability recognizing this banked the oil major desire save money transporting the oil tanker across the black sea and through the turkish strait but when then chair john browne visited istanbul and inspected the narrow bosphorus passage decided the route too risky and threw the weight the oil major behind btc closest relationship the south_caucasus remains with armenia the country most firmly entrenched camp frequently called strategic alliance and for armenia this certainly the case troop based second largest city gyumri form trip wire against turkish military action while azerbaijan generally deal with other country transactionally another criterion take precedence their stance armenia and the karabakh_conflict this the trickiest situation for manage azerbaijan largest trading partner the caucasus the country have important common issue regarding hydrocarbon and see strategic aim keeping azerbaijan out what call the western camp therefore while supporting armenia tried avoid alienating azerbaijan during the recent surge fighting until discreet about arm sale armenia avoid provoking azerbaijan denying report large arm transfer when they surfaced more recently started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry both_side and been more open about balancing for example signed lease military base gyumri extending and agreed sell surface air missile azerbaijan this balancing involved attempt mediate between azerbaijan and armenia resolve the karabakh_conflict since been chair the minsk group body under the aegis the organization for security and operation europe osce and composed number country interested brokering peace the united_state and france joined chair and the three country have conducted all negotiation thereafter without significant input the other group member this structure facilitated west cooperation keep politically insoluble problem flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline state when dmitry medvedev president poured great effort into peace initiative and with french and assent came dominate the process this campaign medvedev also supported the opening between armenia and turkey azerbaijan closest ally that rapprochement failed however due opposition key constituency both_side ultimately azerbaijan and armenia were not interested negotiated solution and medvedev initiative foundered relation with georgia quickly went into downward spiral after the soviet_collapse used substantial military force ensure the survival and then victory the separatist rebellion abkhazia and leveraged that and revolt gamsakhurdia force shevardnadze accept peacekeeping force western georgia still hostile backed attempt and assassinate shevardnadze until the latter attempt shevardnadze had been trying play and the united_state off against each_other but these action drove shevardnadze squarely into the arm the united_state the russian loathed shevardnadze for his role the collapse the soviet bloc television program reviled the ostap bender the soviet_union after the con man protagonist the classic soviet comic novel but that feeling paled beside the emotion stoked the leadership the flamboyant and mercurial mikheil saakashvili who ousted shevardnadze the end and became president that year saakashvili also ousted the quasi independent aslan abashidze his rule over the autonomous batumi region which housed military base also tension flared south_ossetia retaliated over the next few year banning the import georgian product banning flight between and georgia closing the land border between the country and launching aggressive campaign against ethnic georgian citizen their business and their family closed off most north ossetia foreigner allowing preparation for war proceed unseen the outside world and tension flared again south_ossetia troop invaded defeating georgia force short order occupying part georgia outside abkhazia and south_ossetia and incorporating these conquest into the separatist statelets which shortly thererafter recognized independent but the war also brought the expansion competitor presence the small neutral osce mission scrapped and large monitoring mission put place despite the limitation placed that mission the overall presence and commitment sharply increased putin return the presidency came with more assertive foreign_policy leader wholly dependent were installed the separatist entity supported south_ossetia and abkhazia replacing established leader who were pro but possessed their own independent power base more importantly began treat the european union not just nato strategic rival intent taking over part what medvedev had called sphere five year earlier that view had been restricted the senior officer the hard power ministry primarily the military internal affair and security service after putin return the presidency became official policy the ukrainian crisis began with putin pressuring both ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and armenian president serzh sargsyan into repudiating the association agreement they had signed and instead joining the nascent centric eaeu the pressure sargsyan included putin visit azerbaijan capital baku discus arm sale yanukovych caving putin pressure triggered the revolution dignity ukraine and his eventual downfall sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequence explained the nation that security concern necessitated joining the led organization that only could safeguard armenia neighbor however after rejecting the sargsyan immediately tried placate negotiation eventually restarted trade agreement and armenia signed comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with the after few protest armenian fell line with sargsyan capitulation putin wish they assumed their security expectation would met and that this change worth the economic disadvantage giving the association with the indeed when few month later occupied crimea and annexed after the fig leaf controlled referendum armenian saw this model and justification for future annexation nagornyy_karabakh and the surrounding territory action had called into question all territorial disposition after the soviet_collapse which had been agreed among the union republic codified the treaty and endorsed the international community with border questioned and more capable projecting power better close ally than potential victim but april armenian suffered rude awakening april azerbaijan began military operation along the line contact karabakh and over the next four day managed regain few strategic point occupied the karabakh armenian year before reaction maintain balancing act foreign minister sergey lavrov went the region explicitly neutral mediator brought ceasefire plan and proposed the peacekeeping force that had been rejected year earlier that approach did not over with the armenian populace their view armenia treaty ally and had given european aspiration stay camp and therefore should armenia side however far concerned legally the combat had nothing with armenia but between nagornyy_karabakh and azerbaijan the armenian people did not see that way after being convinced their leader over generation that karabakh and armenia had become single polity sargsyan who initially supported the idea peacekeeping force seen having sold out armenian interest then had backtrack putting fatal crack his prestige and authority almost immediately mutiny and demonstration broke out occasionally with subtle anti flavor july group gunman calling themselves sasna tsrer daredevil sassoun armenian epic poem violently took over police station and held out against government force for week demanding sargsyan resignation after they surrendered they retained widespread support which translated into people fed with the ruling elite and with other factor such notorious murder soldier price hike the owned electricity supplier and continued arm sale azerbaijan further exacerbated popular discontent faced with term limit when his presidency expire sargsyan chose the standard post_soviet autocratic solution staying power establishing parliamentary system turning the presidency into figurehead and becoming prime_minister sargsyan and his dashnak nationalist ally duly won parliamentary election and figurehead president due course elected then the play went off script the aggrieved populace rose demonstration and just over month sargsyan ousted opposition_leader nikol pashinyan installed acting prime_minister and election affirmed his position later the year far this scenario resembles the color revolution that putin had railed against for the previous fifteen year and had tried reverse through military force georgia syria and ukraine but instead condemning pashinyan who had sharply criticized during the demonstration and lending full support sargsyan putin most loyal supporter putin remarkably restrained throughout and had friendly and supportive meeting with pashinyan just day after the latter took power publicly offering him his congratulation and best wish possible that blamed sargsyan for the anti sentiment following the clash april but also clear that pashinyan made effort reassure putin like the entire armenian electorate understood that remained the guarantor armenia security larger neighbor also understood that any rift with would create vulnerability that azerbaijan could exploit with regard karabakh pashinyan knew could not afford any daylight between armenia and left armenia the eaeu and csto made clear that would pursue democratic system but also that viewed democracy firm belief rather_than geopolitical orientation making clear the distinction perhaps the fact that putin knew this implying major change armenia strategic orientation occasioned his restraint there threat that armenia leave camp can continue balancing policy toward azerbaijan and armenia azerbaijan the type country with which putin seems feel comfortable stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policy azerbaijan cause few headache for and demand only that transactional approach reciprocated president ilham aliyev began his rule only three year after putin took over his father heydar aliyev had ruled azerbaijan for decade before that not counting the soviet period when also ruled the country his own fiefdom heydar aliyev the senior most rank the soviet state communist_party and security service made his attitude very different other post_soviet ruler some whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki soviet time and saw moscow the source all power heydar aliyev treated post_soviet ruler without the fealty fear that some his contemporary showed ilham aliyev doe not have the experience ability his father but inherited that legacy autonomous sovereignty pashinyan intends show that democracy belief not geopolitical choice the aliyevs have since shown that the same true autocracy azerbaijan and have enjoyed functional transactional relationship that cordial neighborly and devoid emotion some extent azerbaijan grew ideologically closer the wake the ukraine crisis both country saw themselves attacked and undermined fifth column western supported civil_society and nongovernmental organization the chief azerbaijan presidential apparatus usually considered closest the azerbaijani leadership published scathing article outlining that worldview implied that charge human_right violation against country only proved that leadership defending sovereignty but ideological sympathy never overcame azerbaijan transactional approach relation with azerbaijan demanded sharp increase the rent paying for the soviet_era qabala radar station the station the soviet and strategic early warning system and therefore the united_state favored continued functioning help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launch nonetheless azerbaijan stuck price demand and the russian eventually closed the station the end apart transactional approach the azerbaijani leadership single prism for judging the action all other country the karabakh_conflict since independence azerbaijan rejected virtually all form multilateral cooperation involving armenia that imposed durable limit the extent rapprochement with for example azerbaijan not joined the csto which armenia member would have renounce any military solution the karabakh_conflict and been tenet faith azerbaijan that only the credible threat military solution can pressure armenia negotiate seriously nor azerbaijan joined the eaeu armenia did joining could limit azerbaijan ability economic leverage marshal international support karabakh and counter armenian diaspora influence the west particularly the united_state and france indeed because annexation crimea call into question the border the former soviet republic which the republic recognize state border under the alma ata declaration december also call into question the basis for azerbaijani claim sovereignty over nagornyy_karabakh moreover for the last fifteen year proposed principle for negotiated peace the karabakh_conflict have included binding expression the popular the ultimate disposition the territory the staged referendum crimea drove home the azerbaijani how easy for the power with boot the ground ensure desired outcome such vote all all since azerbaijan become anything more transactional approach the offensive karabakh which might earlier have been deterred reluctance antagonize can seen example the fighting azerbaijan initiated september can also seen transaction with made possible turkish intervention sure aim the offensive regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chip armenia side the board but perhaps the larger aim threaten putin with instability and possibly region wide war doe not force deep concession armenia aliyev ignored lavrov initial offer the return province exchange for being allowed deploy peacekeeping force whatever the outcome clear that azerbaijan partner and more problem solved azerbaijan try solve problem through closer relation with particular turkey and china turkey been azerbaijan main advocate the international sphere aside ethnic kinship significant azeri population life eastern turkey and deep historical link before the soviet takeover turkey quick cite certain protectorate right granted under the treaty moscow and kars since independence azerbaijan seen turkey counterweight power present however turkey own complex relation with turkey enjoys the positive effect continued close energy and pipeline relation personal interaction between putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan but offsetting these effect are sharp difference between turkey and the conflict syria and libya azerbaijan seek ensure that turkey support unwavering turkey support azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement the autumn fighting have granted azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver both the battlefield and with regard mediation effort took the kremlin almost week arrange putin aliyev phone call humanitarian truce brokered lavrov fell apart almost immediately china increased engagement with the caucasus belt and road initiative though neither trade nor investment the region compare with far more massive engagement central asia main partner the region azerbaijan which the largest population economy and reserve natural resource the partnership make sense geopolitically although china major trading partner for armenia and georgia armenia too dependent pried loose and china probably wary sensitivity georgia china become the third largest source import for azerbaijan after and turkey azerbaijan present the most potential for future political rapprochement and china unlike the west not burdened with concern over azerbaijan human_right record azerbaijan hope that the belt and road initiative progress china increase azerbaijan for the transit cargo europe floating cargo across the caspian and loading onto the railroad link opened between baku and kars turkey via georgia putin once famously declared that would hang saakashvili his testicle that promise remains unfulfilled but not for want trying saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority and voted out office putin thought saakashvili ouster the billionaire and until shortly before then citizen bidzina ivanishvili and his georgian dream party would liberate wellspring affection for for disappointment the georgian populace remains deeply suspicious late nato

unchanged always the pressure point between and georgia been separatism namely the backed polity abkhazia and south_ossetia the run putin return the presidency serving local official area controlled especially the supported south_ossetia and abkhazia and transdniestria outside the region were ousted with moscow backing newcomer who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience putin alone the end edmund kokoity who had ruled south_ossetia since forced resign the leadership and ultimately replaced leonid tibilov veteran the kgb abkhazia the death sergei bagapsh may triggered premature power struggle that threw the plan off track the election that followed moscow chosen candidate raul khajimba defeated however with the intervention putin fixer vladislav surkov president alexander ankvab ousted june and khajimba installed then had occupied and annexed crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprising donbas kharkiv and odessa response the west had imposed sanction perhaps this left putin and his regime concerned with placating western opinion and moved annex the separatist all but name early october the month after khajimba inauguration presented abkhazia with draft treaty alliance integration and partnership whose main point were the takeover key executive department the abkhaz state their homologues with best nominal abkhazian security institution serving fig leaf presented south_ossetia with draft comprising identical term about the same though the public announcement came november the treaty that were eventually signed the abkhaz won face saving concession the russian took four draft before the south ossetians signed but their version closer the original the close informal relation between south_ossetia and north ossetia made the word paper important the stifling embrace moscow and the suspected poisoning khajimba electoral rival led the ouster khajimba early and his replacement aslan bzhania himself veteran the kgb south_ossetia anatoliy bibilov who had floated between the north and south ossetian military defeated tibilov action have continued ensure that georgian resentment over the remains open wound

and again after murky incident the lopota gorge between the pankisi gorge and dagestan that georgia arming and training chechen militant fight inside several year after saakashvili replaced the anti georgian dream party the chechen commander involved the lopota incident killed georgian security force tbilisi thus cycle perceived provocation followed emotional reaction and retaliation continues

reconciliation between the orthodox majority and georgia june member the state duma presided over the session and sat the georgian parliament chair seat violent street protest immediately broke out tbilisi disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation georgia parliament chair the following amid continuing protest against tbilisi putin ordered the cessation direct flight between georgia and had the run the war the incident highlight that symbol power relation evoke both charged emotion and material retaliation and that the pattern event repeated for the foreseeable future hard not conclude that putin personal overreach ukraine led suboptimal result for the south_caucasus when resumed the presidency putin increased engagement with the south_caucasus perhaps hoping gather some castaway stone closer into the camp autumn everything seemed going his way armenia and ukraine had bowed his demand reject association agreement with the and sign instead with the eaeu that putin had singlehandedly created promoted and dominated relation with azerbaijan were keel without expenditure effort and georgia despised saakashvili had been replaced billionaire whose government floating

economic sanction moscow punishment for bad behavior and foremost for interference the presidential_election this view widely shared pro kremlin pundit senior official and the executive state owned enterprise and promoted the few remaining independent medium outlet such the newsletter daily staple the information diet the upper middle class more nuanced view biden held some people working issue the government president who not tainted suspicion being asset and who know how organize normal process for national_security discussion able restore some guardrail the relationship and prevent further deterioration those people argue president biden would not able pay close attention since and his senior adviser overwhelmed domestic issue and otherwise focusing china but possible democratic administration appears open retaining some pillar the arm_control regime and discussing rule competition cyberspace and could more clear eyed and therefore skeptical about the side effect and efficiency sanction the united_state major tool policy depend who put senior position such secretary state and national_security advisor and the midlevel bureaucrat controlling the portfolio after

according timothy ash senior emerging market strategist bluebay asset management saturday that while the course relation remain this deteriorating path not sure that should expect immediate rollout

the united_state with the apparent goal dissuading them supporting the biden harris ticket sign for cnn opinion join and both country are cooperating more than ever but would moscow really help beijing that way the knowledge but china the money would moscow help beijing for the right price appears that china relying how and experience develop the reactor for nuclear aircraft carrier the report china appears studying the nuclear reactor largest icebreaker approach that the soviet_union also took when planned build nuclear carrier the specifically invited china bid the construction class nuclear icebreaker necessarily requiring the development surface ship based reactor this approach stand contrast how the united_state and france developed nuclear reactor for their largest carrier but probably represents the best choice for china this point appreciate what stake china pursuit nuclear powered surface warship important review the experience the united_state and the ussr after the successful development the and the class nuclear attack submarine the merchant ship provided proof concept regarding nuclear propulsion the usn began evaluate nuclear power for surface warship the usn nuclear surface warship the cruiser commissioned powered reactor generating around enough power produce speed knot for the ton cruiser hull the usn rapidly followed with enterprise powered reactor each quite similar construction and output the those reactor generated each translating shp driving the ton knot few other nuclear cruiser and destroyer followed but the advantage nuclear power surface warfare ship limited cost aircraft carrier were different story the class which began enter service reactor each rated the recently commissioned carry reactor capable generating the extra power generation capacity the little with speed rather the power provides surplus usable for variety different system emals and highly sophisticated sensor down the road the extra energy may power point defense laser and similar equipment overall the reactor open space modernize and modify the vessel keeping them effective for their decade project life the soviet experience somewhat different while the soviet enjoyed considerable success developing nuclear reactor for submarine they approached the question surface warship more carefully the nuclear powered soviet ship the icebreaker commissioned with three reactor each between and the soviet would commission nine more nuclear icebreaker the and class generally displacing between and ton and carrying reactor capable these ship provided valuable experience but the soviet were slow the leap nuclear powered surface combatant because soviet warship were expected operate closer home than their counterpart however the soviet began building the four ship the class ton battlecruisers with both nuclear and conventional propulsion report differ the power capacity the reactor with range these reactor would also have powered the class supercarriers class ship that canceled upon the collapse the ussr the chinese are undoubtedly thinking along line similar those the late soviet conventional catobar carrier suggest ship roughly the size and sophistication the which course would require immense power generation capability like the united_state china want excess power generation order field suite future weapon and sensor for this purpose china need reactor more powerful than those that currently submarine and building icebreaker for may provide the necessary experience this approach stand contrast that the french navy which decided upscale based experience building nuclear reactor for submarine while france enjoyed success with nuclear sub the widely believed underpowered relative other fleet carrier areva reactor the same type employed french submarine these reactor provide each but only drive the ton carrier some knot worth noting that india considered but wisely rejected the idea building vishal nuclear carrier largely because the technical challenge developing powerful enough reactor the idea using technical data and nuclear how certainly make sense the perspective the people liberation army navy the plan doesn have the luxury the incremental approach adopted the united_state and good reason find the french approach insufficient need that the russian seem okay with letting the chinese study their icebreaker suggests once again that moscow and beijing currently see cooperation their term interest course nothing certain until china nuclear carrier actually enters service

suite technology product just day later the reported analyst also point out that overdue digitization surge and there could easily room for both emerge winner but behind this another conflict the kremlin ever expanding attempt bring technology firm under the state control both company have played role these effort yandex been under kremlin give the government more influence over decision and sberbank state owned enterprise the latter the government corporate takeover such yandex acquisition tinkoff are pushing major tech_company into ever growing conglomerate controlled either directly the government other actor trusted advance kremlin internet policy but the kremlin toolkit coercion broader and more international than this tactic the government recognized the scale political and economic power wielded internet company and sought channel that power toward own end since war against ukraine the government carried out rapidly escalating crackdown internet freedom but the hostile attitude toward freedom information underlying internet policy changed little since vladimir_putin took office the kremlin strategy for the internet way mirrored the approach used early the putin era bring major broadcast and print medium then the major mean information dissemination under effective government control that the internet played meaningful role how most the public read the news communicated with another and therefore escaped major attempt government interference the year since however the importance dramatically most the world controlling the internet become higher priority for government willing ever more authoritarian tactic addition effort control online medium outlet the government recognition the internet power tool for communication prioritized maximizing surveillance potential and enlisted social_medium and other tech_company this push through publicly enacted measure created legal and technological framework for the internet under which only encryption rather_than any legal protection can effectively prevent the authority viewing the content any internet traffic within the country third goal which receives surprisingly little attention relative potential significance enlist internet company the government foreign espionage effort this topic may downplayed due justified cynicism would course naive assume that the government alone such conduct authoritarian and democratic government alike regularly demand user information most often calling necessary for the criminal justice process but had unique case made public april pavel durov the founder vkontakte known most popular social_medium platform received the previous december the country federal security service fsb which responsible for domestic security but also foreign electronic surveillance the letter demanded the personal data user running popular group involved the ukrainian euromaidan protest movement that would ultimately result the ouster ukrainian president viktor yanukovych the fsb demand demonstrate the power the government requisition user data privately owned social_medium company expressly order conduct espionage abroad what set this apart the surveillance practice most democratic government the united_state the lack any political legal check that could serve protect user privacy when edward snowden disclosure the prism program revealed that intelligence collecting data social_medium platform such surveillance became major story politics tech_company their user behalf changed their practice better protect user data government collection and challenge surveillance practice earning praise the american civil liberty union and other privacy activist where the putin regime had already destroyed judicial independence asserted control most medium outlet and seriously weakened civil_society durov revelation had little impact public discourse around surveillance and the tech sector already that point largely under kremlin control produced comparable response story illustrative the different tactic broadly employed the government effort gain control when durov published his letter the fsb four month after receiving had already fled that final conflict only the latest between durov and the government that included incident when durov refused prosecutor order down page being used organize protest against fraudulent parliamentary election provoking police special force raid his apartment raid masked and armed police the office tech_company and the home their owner are they are some extent all profitable part the economy these extortion tactic are often paired with corporate ownership maneuver aimed bringing those company under the ownership state controlled company kremlin friendly businessmen the case the personal pressure against durov occurred against backdrop tech giant owned the billionaire and close putin ally alisher usmanov acquire controlling stake when mail few month after durov fled the company added most popular social network product portfolio that already included namesake email service the most used webmail provider and odnoklassniki the country second most popular social network corporate consolidation the tech sector pose problem for freedom expression and information everywhere however the primary driving force behind such consolidation not the company own economic motivation but rather the government political aim the case mail these platform were under the control owner ready and willing his immense wealth and power and that merger however not the end the kremlin corporate takeover instrument control the country tech giant yandex which addition operating most used search engine maintains news aggregator that the single most popular news source the internet and therefore similarly been but yandex did not directly result these tactic instead the most proximate cause the threat legislation that would limit prohibit foreign ownership tech_company this case the relevant legislation directly intended pressure yandex into corporate restructuring evidenced the fact that the legislation introduced during sberbank takeover attempt and then withdrawn after yandex voluntarily restructured other legislation however constrained the activity company number way going beyond ownership the government surveillance system known the acronym sorm infrastructure since the with update implemented capture more internet and mobile phone communication technology evolved company have little ability push back sorm give the fsb the capability and the legal right collect data private company without those company knowledge law allowing internet oversight agency roskomnadzor order the blocking website supposedly engaged criminal activity censor political speech leaving publisher and user blocked site legal recourse most recently the yarovaya and sovereign internet law which entered into force and respectively have and undermined any remaining legal technical capacity that they might have protect user privacy surveillance supply user with uncensored information outside the country all this lead grim conclusion barring dramatic political reform the tech business sector can no_longer source independent action behalf free internet and russian seeking the internet for private communication and uncensored information have turn elsewhere the outlook for international company while certainly more optimistic also clear moscow goal when come international technology company those incorporated other country but operating are quite similar those pursues with domestic firm authority want maximize surveillance potential disrupt any possibility domestic political unrest result those company content service and continue projecting disinformation through the internet recent battle over data localization the mandated storage certain kind data within border exemplify the kremlin desire maximize own surveillance potential through foreign company like authoritarian government that viewed the internet free information flow threat regime security moscow that company with data citizen store locally firm could maintain copy the data elsewhere but the data itself had sit server within the broad legal and political jurisdiction the security service described above recent year company like facebook and twitter have seemingly just these order and continued paying the trivial court ordered but pressure are likely grow putin further move cement state control over data storage fit into broader picture government effort centralize internet data flow designed the internet inception prioritize fast and reliable delivery above all else enable more effective government management and surveillance though the process often purely technical the objective are fundamentally political practice these measure allow the government surveil dissident ensure the privacy citizen data against perceived malicious foreign access and extend state information control the digital domain simultaneously justifying the kremlin other main goal this sphere disrupting the potential for political pluralism enabled foreign tech platform and projecting the state own disinformation through those same vector requires kind argumentative gymnastics the government for year required foreign internet company operating remove content deems false should company not comply the kremlin vested power roskomnadzor initiate technical block those website although these block are often evaded poorly implemented the government still managed pressure foreign company related the covid crisis this minimizes the presence state critical contradictory information online the same government propaganda outlet often have large presence major western platform like twitter and youtube and official anytime those firm action against state controlled news outlet these inherent contradiction the government approach international tech_company the kremlin want these company operate but only the kremlin own term pressure company suppress free speech inside but howl when government messaging abroad met with wariness mean that there still space for international company effect certain extent internet freedom for citizen this operating space however under constant threat the government and likely the site several major conflict coming year international firm may continue push back against certain element state internet control firm that have mostly resisted complying with data localization rule have not indicated any changed willingness follow kremlin pressure though resistance this kind won apply every area online important not group different component internet control here content takedown for example are domain internet control the covid pandemic where the government quite successful getting social_medium company their platform within that official deemed false second the struggle maintain free internet increasingly defined technical dimension the government june decided telegram the encrypted messaging app essentially lacked the technical capacity block ironically this comprises certain kind payback for none other than pavel durov telegram creator who since losing and fleeing built his messaging app into the world most popular the sovereign internet law that came into force for developing pernicious technical censorship capability perhaps most ominously the ability selectively censor content international social_medium platform while maintaining plausible deniability also required domestic internet company centralize their architecture authority could potentially cut off the internet the rest the world the event security incident broadly defined thus incumbent supporter internet freedom continue developing anti censorship technology and maintain the kind technical edge that allowed telegram continue operating without compromising surveillance censorship

demand for gas continue grow particularly asia more country draw line burning coal which emits almost double the carbon dioxide gas but demand for gas which met state gas monopoly gazprom could fall below level the end the decade according novak also planned become global player the hydrogen economy producing and transporting the clean burning alternative traditional fossil fuel gas hydrogen can produced either using renewable energy split water molecule process known electrolysis splitting off the carbon dioxide gas through pyrolysis novak able both and also developing technology capture the carbon emission created during hydrogen production offer genuinely green gas customer using existing gas transport channel all this been quite expensive far but believe that just like with the renewable energy source which determine the pace hydrogen adoption put briefly can produce hydrogen and deliver consumer can also export the hydrogen production technology novak pursuing hydrogen production would safeguard fossil fuel economy while helping reduce emission worldwide but environmental group carbon action tracker have nonetheless branded climate plan the emission target set

headline really helped him get his message outside those inside the propaganda feedback loop and into the more mainstream benkler say cornell university study that analyzed million article about the

other republican are the biggest driver falsehood about voting medium outlet have adopted dual track where they report trump claim look balanced and then back fact check benkler say but what initially

policymakers understand and support the current unrest different part the former soviet_union may tempting that losing control over neighbourhood and true that over some area hold weakened loss ukraine undeniable and serious however the current ruction not mark decline but demonstrate rather the opposite working settlement for nagorno_karabakh and belarus and doing according own principle meanwhile the west lack workable leverage over either issue may appear the back foot misunderstands aim assuming that nagorno_karabakh stand unconditionally behind armenia collective security treaty organisation ally whose control nagorno_karabakh azerbaijan relies military support also wrong assume that belarus moscow stand fully behind alyaksandr lukashenka the authoritarian leader who declared his friendship towards though not always lived fact moscow quite tired lukashenka faced behaviour and would like see change minsk might also accept some change nagorno_karabakh happens moscow term at_least term understandable moscow true aim these neighbourhood conflict not back particular side personality but defend the principle value want delegitimise bottom revolution mean transferring power also want signal that western interventionism with promotion democracy and normative approach are unfruitful general and unwelcome around particular what playing out essentially the same philosophy that guided intervention syria and judged against these criterion moscow doing enough at_least the moment moscow want delegitimise bottom revolution mean arrange transfer power belarus for instance moscow might backing lukashenka for but reality already working his replacement this process some lukashenka have some over the term his exit recent meeting held with opposition figure jail probably this process svitlana tsikhanouskaya though the opposition_leader based lithuania and the likely real winner the rigged election probably been prescribed the role bystander moscow and europe the start moscow shunned all european call for due procedure respect for human_right and mediation the osce vladimir_putin last week encapsulated his country position though somewhat hypocritically when did not interfere what happening belarus and expect else interfere either should stirring this conflict promote their own interest and impose any decision the belarusian people nagorno_karabakh different type conflict ethnic territorial kind and the onslaught fighting with azerbaijan emboldened turkish support might suggest that facing rival power neighbourhood but for moscow the advantage having the west out still outweighs the nuisance having turkey moscow know ankara and learned work with the capital are far being ally their goal the middle_east often stand direct opposition each_other but both realise they each_other they cannot achieve their aim without some acquiescence the other and most importantly the turkish government motivated goal that the kremlin eye are rational strengthening power home enhancing leverage abroad and pursuing economic and security interest lack any western style rule centric approach and instead subscribes worldview that moscow understands azerbaijan too pursued foreign_policy without challenging philosophical standpoint historical narrative though time been odds with moscow this why might more relaxed than expected though armenian ally trouble may have reason help ally armenia but reason all punish azerbaijan which been example model behavior among the former soviet state far concerned carnegie scholar alexander baunov nagorno_karabakh again moscow that brought the warring side together and arranged for ceasefire though admittedly shaky the western member the contact group have largely been european have tried different way influence the situation belarus lithuania for instance positioned itself the moral high ground arranged public show solidarity with the belarusian opposition and called for harsh sanction against the regime france dialogue with putin trying get the latter accept osce mediation collectively leader made great effort august signal moscow their restraint and desire not geopoliticise the conflict the hope that moscow would mirror the position thus allowing for armenian style political transition with geopolitical contest around all avail after adopting wait and see position for around week after the election moscow made mind and embarked strategy transition that save some face for lukashenka deepens leverage the country brings power leader acceptable moscow keep both the west and the osce arm length and most importantly demonstrates that popular revolution not effective way transfer power can imagine scenario under which moscow could reconsider approach change strategy and reach out the lithuania based opposition but all these would stem development inside belarus itself such strike that paralyse the country the regime splitting and crumbling

strategic connotation seen both the country promote the idea building multipolar world order and changing the global financial structure this regard both india and have envisaged promoting harmonious global order based international law and collective decision making that includes developing country and not monopolised developed country alone india and along with other player such china have succeeded establishing non western organisation such brics and sco the member state have within their capability and limitation established mechanism that address economic and strategic interest such the development bank while brics and sco have become tool political signalling issue related global affair there however exist asymmetry among the member state with regard economic growth performance distribution resource and military strength additionally although china member such multilateral organisation the individual level beijing exercised assertive posturing that caused concern india this can seen irrational border claim and action the indian ocean region the role especially during the crisis between india and china therefore anticipated non partisan and meaningful when the treaty strategic_partnership signed the world the brink war terrorism after the terrorist attack the world trade centre both india and their respective level joined the bandwagon the global war terror both party bilateral partner which have been victim terrorist attack voiced their interest and concern combating terrorism and related activity india and have therefore cooperated bilateral and

soviet_era and continued remain today fact both country have agreed expand their relation the aerospace sphere area traditional cooperation for decade more than joint project involving scientist and research institute both country have been undertaken within the framework various initiative since while critically evaluating the decade strategic_partnership between india and tempting compare india strategic_partnership with other major global player and the strategic_partnership that share with the reality the dynamic nature international relation have definitely posed challenge the partnership the pursuing all alignment foreign_policy caused certain level discomfort the bilateral_relation india growing proximity with the and compromised defence cooperation with china and mending tie with pakistan recent time caused anxiety the strategic_partnership between india and possible inference that can draw the constant comparison the current india partnership with that the nostalgia indo soviet tie but need bear mind that compared the strategic_partnership that both india and share with other major player there are limitation and shrouded with lack trust india defence relation with for instance yet any substantive development joint production and restrictiveness about technology compared generosity sharing defence technology and relation with pakistan eclipsed with lack trust and understanding for china relation there growing speculation possible role reversal the partnership given china growth global politics recent time however there are few stumbling block india defence cooperation especially the shifting trend partnership for example defence engagement between and china current cooperation with china emerged exclusively includes cooperation sensitive field such strategic missile defence hypersonic technology and the construction nuclear submarine with allowing for the latter equipped with similar and more advanced capability china major security concern for india hence given the way collaboration advanced future weapon system quantum technology and artificial intelligence should enhanced further between india and indo relation are undoubtedly the cusp litmus test nonetheless the strategic_partnership should see the future asia beyond the and china factor and both india and can play decisive role promoting their mutual_interest the region the rapid and uncontrollable spread covid the past seven month impacted the global order and the interconnected system reflecting the spirit the partnership time crisis also welcomed india goodwill gesture send medical supply help fight the virus critic have often pointed out that the strategic_partnership yet achieve full potential given the fact that some the sphere cooperation continue remain obsolete for instance the economic relation additionally given nearly year diplomatic relation soft power capability cultural diplomacy academic exchange programme and labour migration are imperceptible status trade and investment remains the weakest link our strategic_partnership and fall far short our potential which unfortunately not commensurate with our high level political cooperation post the

strategic community incomplete there shortfall establishing strong people people engagement since the soviet_collapse bilateral_relation have seen minimal cultural diplomacy academic exchange and labour migration perhaps vista cooperation could explored promote soft power capability between the country such cinema which always been the most successful foreign_policy tool enhance cultural exchange and people people contact between country the film industry great medium for spreading narrative and india movie have immense following impact the mind the population india and collaborated movie production during the soviet_era however the trend did not last due the fall the soviet_union among other factor the right for both india and collaborate the entertainment industry especially

the series which were going work very hard nonpartisan run between the and the inauguration and finally should mention listener that this episode going run the after the election but that you and are taping the friday before the election you and have idea whats going happen election people should just that theyre theyre listening our conversation and thats actually good thing for our conversation because what want the end the get your sense what going face the president who sworn january matter who that person happens michael_morrell before get the individual issue that want walk through with you love ask you why you decided write the book that you did you obviously could have written very different kind book and sure that there were publisher who were encouraging you that but you chose not that you chose write very serious look the threat and challenge that face nation why did you the route that you did gen_mcmaster michael thank_you served the army for thirty four year transitioned what only second career adult life made out probably quite predictably mission statement for myself and that second career try deepen our understanding the most crucial challenge face way better inform the american people about foreign_policy and national_security issue and with the hope that learn more about these challenge that face can demand better demand better foreign_policy our elected leader but then also hope that the book and the work that doing around the book help bring american back together right because dont any these issue should partisan nature what hoping for that deeper understanding these challenge face and what should our common commitment try build better future for generation come help bring our country back together at_least around foreign_policy and national_security issue michael_morrell what are the main theme the book what you want reader walk away remembering gen_mcmaster what are the theme that run through the book this idea strategic narcissism this the reason why our competence our ability compete at_least the post cold_war period been significantly diminished and strategic narcissism mean our tendency define the world only relation and then assume that what decide decide not decisive achieving favorable outcome and course you michael with your experience with intelligence this flawed because self referential and doesnt acknowledge you the degree which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future the book then argument argument for cultivating with friend and great historian zachary shore termed strategic empathy and this effort effort understand better what drive and constrains the other especially adversary rival and enemy and what drive and constrains the other often time ideology and emotion and aspiration the theme the book that also important effort understand how the recent past produced the present the step making projection into the future the book argument for the understanding history and appreciation for the complex causality event and focus understanding these crucial challenge were facing the perspective the perspective others michael_morrell you thats the thats the main job the intelligence community right give our decision maker the point view the other guy the guy sitting across the table you the guy sitting across the battlefield you but whats the other guy thinking what are his constraint what are his interest and thats extraordinarily important right gen_mcmaster course not idea back sun tzu but started neglect the importance this especially the post cold_war period period that describe period over optimism over optimism that led complacency and bit hubris and this over optimism large measure set set for significant disappointment the thousand disappointment course associated with the mass murder attack september but also the unanticipated length and difficulty war afghanistan and iraq and course followed financial crisis and the thousand that this emotional impetus behind our foreign_policy shifted overoptimism pessimism and maybe tendency under appreciate the risk and cost action tendency underappreciate the risk and cost inaction and that strategic narcissism the cause really both case michael_morrell you the other thing that strike when you talk about the importance history always thought sitting deputy meeting that would have been incredibly valuable actually few minute and every deputy meeting principal meeting talk about the history the issue just review how you got point point and never did that multiple administration which served but always thought that that would have been really valuable gen_mcmaster michael youre absolutely right about that ill tell you the the great gift had before earlier career the opportunity read thing study and write history and the book wrote which story about how and why vietnam became american war and the lesson learned the study that history that important understand problem and challenge holistically before leaping into action when came national_security adviser did best at_least avoid making the same mistake and put place principle small group framing session thats mouthful but developed these strategy for the most crucial challenge were facing began with this framing session that organized around five page paper that included only really the description the challenge how got where are bit the history and then inventory our vital interest that were stake view that challenge through the lens those vital interest and draft overarching goal and more specific objective followed assumption assumption about the degree which and like minded partner have agency influence over this challenge then inventory obstacle progress and opportunity that could exploit and thats then had discussion about the nature the challenge the policy coordinating committee which you are the real worker who are going work this project theyre listening theyre getting theyre hearing the cabinet level discussion about the nature the problem and then refinement once that the meeting done then shifted discussion what are your idea how integrate the element national power and effort like minded partner overcome these obstacle and exploit these opportunity then they got hear the treasury secretary what have have economic and financial tool available but those ought combined with diplomacy and maybe law_enforcement effort and then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with that hope thats process that sustained dont successor hung onto have resurrected some point deemed useful future national_security adviser michael_morrell michael_morrell today have with mcmaster senior_fellow both stanford university hoover institution and graduate school business career army officer and national_security adviser president trump what love through the individual issue and what like just throw out get you frame whats the threat challenge that face whats the history how did get here whats our interest thats stake and how you nation about dealing with let start with the big let start with the big enchilada china gen_mcmaster china great example strategic narcissism work and especially this assumption that clung for too that china having been welcomed into the international order would play the rule would liberalize economy and prospered would liberalize form government course thats not true thats not true because undervalue the degree which emotion and ideology drive and constrain the chinese communist_party and what would argue battleground that the party driven mainly fear fear losing exclusive grip power and associated ambition the ambition achieve national rejuvenation for china center stage the world again after the tragedy they portrayed the century humiliation that combination fear and aspiration that driving the party effort extend and tighten exclusive grip power internally this why there are over million people concentration camp xinjiang and there campaign cultural genocide ongoing this why the party extending their repressive arm hong kong and perfecting their technologically enabled orwellian surveillance police state this what were seeing and then what more troubling the party effort export authoritarian mercantilist model through number strategy that aim create servile relationship with country and then ultimately through economic mean the growth the people liberation army capability establish area privacy across the pacific region that exclude the united_state and then challenged the united_state the free world globally china succeeds mean our world free prosperous and safe the stake are high and past for recognize the compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form aggression that the party engaged michael_morrell what would effective china strategy look like you gen_mcmaster the trump administration get credit for anything should get credit for fundamental shift our policy toward china that overdue and that fundamentally sound and this the idea that have compete and under the strategy cooperation and engagement that the chinese communist_party emboldened competition doesnt lead confrontation fact quite the opposite and have returned arena competition involving countering more effectively china campaign sustained industrial espionage against countering range china unfair trade and economic practice doing large measure through effective international cooperation for example establishing better standard for infrastructure investment internationally the law_enforcement action and investigation that have gone against apt the main hacking arm the chinese communist_party have been very effective combined with sanction and other action against the aggressive arm the party but really the most important thing for and argue this chapter battleground entitled turning weakness into strength what the chinese communist_party see source weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strength what doe the party fear the party fear that the people the chinese people might want have how theyre governed should strengthen our democratic process the party fear rule law should strengthen rule law the united_state and with country that are working strengthen rule law their country the party fear freedom press freedom the expression strengthen our authoritative source information and recognize that investigative journalism great counter some these pernicious strategy that the party are pursuing that defensive but more introspective and trying maintain our competitive advantage michael_morrell this intelligence matter michael_morrell were talking with former national_security adviser mcmaster how you about gen_mcmaster significant threat because putin again examining the assumption previous policy putin not going become like the grinch christmas eve right his heart not going get too big the size get bigger and not going decide maybe the future doe lie more with the west and treat the united_state and europe and others differently putin driven sense honor lost after the breakup the soviet_union also driven this associated desire restore national greatness also cognizant though the fact that cannot compete with this our own term and what his theory victory drag all down and then the last man standing and the mean that using this describe the chinese approach cooption coercion and concealment and alliteration the chapter campaign disruption disinformation and denial try disrupt disrupt our effective governance disrupt economically and economic coercion when can such done europe effectively and with energy dependence then deny his most egregious act especially the sustained campaign cyber enabled information warfare against which designed polarize pit against each_other reduce our confidence who are people and our democratic institution and principle and process dangerous threat for for these reason and the best way counter the step pull the curtain back this activity educate ourselves about susceptible information not our own worst enemy both political party instance have because they compromise and they compromised our principle score some partisan political point and doing themselves vulnerable disinformation and propaganda michael_morrell then what about raising the cost him doing this that option here term deterring him gen_mcmaster absolutely this what advocated for battleground that have impose cost the kremlin putin that exceed those that factor the beginning his decision making process last really oval office meeting the that president trump decided impose significant cost response the attempted poisoning murder sergei skripal and his daughter with with banned military grade nerve agent and act that put thousand citizen risk and that that occasion that expelled you over undeclared intelligence agent that hit putin where matter because these are agent that were critical his sustained campaign subversion against and impose significant cost additional cost through sanction and other action the closing the san francisco consulate you michael major intelligence collection platform for the russian here silicon valley and the bay area that significant and that sent strong message after navalnys poisoning like see the same thing you and infiltrating more little green men into belarus and continues enable the serial episode mass homicide that the syrian civil war support hawthorne way perpetuating violence libya michael_morrell michael morell were talking with mcmaster former national_security adviser president trump and author the just published book the way you missed any today show you can listen podcast just search wherever you get your podcasts let talk about north_korea give your sense north_korea gen_mcmaster thanks michael course important for recognize going right that north_korea the only communist hereditary dictatorship the world and the nature the kim family regime that have into account when were considering the danger that the regime pose the world doe posse the most destructive weapon earth the kim family regime driven mainly this drive remain power course known the hermit kingdom gulag state that fear any kind opening the world and regime that across three generation dictator been committed unifying the korean peninsula under the called red banner and look north_korea pursuit the most destructive weapon earth have at_least open the possibility that want those weapon coerce the united_state off the peninsula the step the forcible reunification the peninsula and course that would that would the form destructive war gen_mcmaster also important for recognize that highly unlikely that north_korea want nuclear weapon just deter north_korea already had very significant deterrence capability with conventional weapon and the fact that thousand artillery piece are within the range seoul south korea and then also important recognize that every act aggression the korean peninsula since the north invaded the south june been initiated the north the other aspect this problem michael that very important consider that north_korea get the weapon recognized nuclear power like who doesnt get after that right this japan start have conversation with south korea the way north_korea never met weapon didnt try sell somebody excluding nuclear program until the israeli defense force bombed that facility very dangerous dangerous because the ideology that drive this regime warped ideology this the zushi ideology which turned deprivation into sign virtue and racial superiority and the north korean people have gone through generation brainwashing this big problem michael that the approach that place the strategy maximum pressure the best course action have test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince kim jong that safer without the weapon than with them important for whoever sworn january that they recognize that should not repeat the failed pattern previous effort not allow north_korea draw into negotiation with act aggression and with the demand big payoff front just for the privilege talking with them not again engage drawn out negotiation that delivers weak agreement that immediately break again michael_morrell youve something here that really important because the conventional wisdom that want these weapon for deterrence right that worried about attacking him but youre arguing that more than that that this get the heart what north_korea always wanted which reunify the peninsula which really important point here that change how you about how you have deal with him gen_mcmaster this argument michael for strategic empathy right view these complex challenge the perspective the other and unless you that youre susceptible mirror imaging and course research for the book you that sensitized this the run the vietnam war where some those who were planning the vietnam strategy development the strategy actually referred the reasonable man theory english common law and assumed that chi minh would respond the theoretical reasonable man would respond without taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played driving and constraining the north vietnamese leadership michael_morrell you the end the possible convince him that would better off that would more secure without these weapon gen_mcmaster possible and the reason possible because weve never really put maximum pressure the north and have this opportunity thanks really the tremendous work ambassador nikki haley when she the you michael these security council sanction north_korea are unprecedented and reach the key though enforce them course the key country that need enforce them china and china doesnt enforce them china continues complicit with illicit financial flow into and out the country continue provide energy and other material the north that are limited these sanction then for consider secondary sanction and maybe chinese financial institution gen_mcmaster see the smuggling coal and the transshipment coal and oil and fuel that under article the president could article authority interdict those ship you michael this something cant really talk about there are other mean putting pressure the north that havent done yet have at_least test the thesis because the alternative are bleak either accepting north_korea nuclear power and coping with that threat war right that would very costly worth pursuing michael_morrell still have more discus with general mcmaster and right back with our final segment michael_morrell were back with more intelligence matter michael_morrell our guest mcmaster senior_fellow both stanford university hoover institution and graduate school business sir let ask you about another tough iran gen_mcmaster iran what tell the story michael have view the problem iran with fundamental consideration foremost our mind the the ideology the revolution and how that drive iranian leadership and the iranian leadership the supreme leader and the guardian council and the islamic revolutionary guard corp have this fantasy that the reformer the republican within iraq are going prevail they lost the revolutionary are charge the hardliner are charge and whenever they put this forward the shop window minister zarif their foreign minister president rouhani thats all youre getting the shop window that ideology drive the iranian regime continue four decade proxy_war against the great satan the united_state the little satan israel the arab monarchy and the west broadly and have consider the ideology the regime and and this year proxy_war gen_mcmaster what argue for the book force the iranian regime choice you can either treated like normal nation you can continue wage this proxy_war support terrorist organization and keep the middle_east enmeshed this perpetual state sectarian civil war the choice yours and impose that choice what should not lift the arm embargo the regime what should not lift any the sanction fact should impose the cost the regime constrain the resource they have available continue their proxy_war against but then also ultimately maybe convince the iranian people that they ought have government place and not talking about like regime change but government place that shift away permanent hostility the united_state israel and the west thats the only path that see forward our policy ought aim effect that change the regime permanent hostility and until doe any agreement with them cant trusted and any agreement with them that allows them escape making that choice like the iran nuclear deal did our disadvantage michael_morrell you dont see the regime changing policy own you that forced internally the iranian people that fair gen_mcmaster michael iran important keep consideration mind crafting strategy toward iran all that the ideology the regime that drive their hostile behavior toward and have recognize that the supreme leader the guardian council islamic revolutionary guard corp who are charge right there struggle you across the history iran since the revolution between the republican and the revolutionary hey the revolutionary won and and have recognize that the second consideration that this regime waged four decade proxy_war against the great satan the little satan israel the arab monarchy and the west generally have craft our strategy recognition this regime permanent hostility course the best way approach the title the chapter forcing the regime choice either being responsible nation and then being treated such suffering the consequence and this why very important keep the arm embargo place very important keep the sanction place the regime the short term reduce the resource available wage this proxy_war and the term hopefully convince the iranian people demand change the nature the government such that cease permanent hostility michael_morrell okay islamic extremism waned bit the threat but still there west africa the middle_east south asia southeast asia how you about that problem term gen_mcmaster the reason that havent had another attack the scale the most devastating terrorist attack history september our tremendous intelligence professional our diplomat our military who been engaged against this threat jihadist terrorist organization since what concerned about michael that these group are more dangerous today than they were maybe september and thats because course those who committed the mass murder attack against were the mujahideen alumnus the resistance the soviet occupation afghanistan the qaida alumnus the isi alumnus the lashkar taiba alumnus are order magnitude greater and they have access more and more destructive capability and the reason weve been safe because weve been engaged and have this narrative ending endless war and disengaging what american that are engaged can enable others bear the brunt this fight mean this disengagement afghanistan tragedy the way that weve gone about this should recognize the sacrifice our longest war and particular that our courageous serviceman soldier gave their life for our country our security this year but have also recognize that afghan soldier and police die defending the freedom that theyve enjoyed since the defeat the taliban removal the taliban power that sustained argument the american people for engagement with this problem jihadist terrorism because dont michael back remember when after the embassy bombing fired few cruise_missile and called right that didnt work out michael_morrell the last issue want ask you about venezuela which you care about understanding that when you arrived the white_house you were going over the issue and you kind stumbled venezuela and hey you whats going there that doesnt look like were paying attention this talk about venezuela and why important gen_mcmaster immensely important because this humanitarian catastrophe venezuela humanitarian catastrophe thats brought authoritarian regime that denying the venezuelan people how theyre governed when looked the problem and the nature the maduro regime and the chavista movement concluded that this again corrupt government that using criminalized patronage network effect control people these motorcycle gang and militia overwhelm any kind opposition ended the constitution whats should our goal our goal should work with others work with like minded country effect restoration constitutional rule venezuela and that felt had pursue three objective those objective would try strengthen the opposition right help the opposition come together you saw that with the rise bolsonaro you who really the people you not member the caracas polo club for example somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged significantly under chavez and maduro gen_mcmaster the second objective would for the people able attribute their grievance back the government not blame the yankee you for example and the third related that would try galvanize really popular support for restoration constitutional government the measure put place were sound course they have proven inadequate and thought that economic sanction would maybe have significant effect but the reason they havent had bigger effect there huge black market illicit economy thats run maduro that sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gang thug who really prevent any real opposition gaining traction but proud what did this period worked very closely with partner especially the western hemisphere mexico under the foreign minister the great luis videgaray who wonderful partner took leading role the work that did tryd get the organization american state and others more but really the community like minded nation brazil colombia peru panama argentina worked very closely together this problem and remain committed trying effect restoration constitutional government venezuela michael_morrell youve been fantastic with your just want ask you more question have couple minute left quick here michael_morrell the that order deal with all these problem that youve talked about you healthy national_security toolkit healthy diplomacy healthy intelligence capability healthy military capability whats your assessment sort overall where are with our national_security toolkit gen_mcmaster were good shape thanks the extremely dedicated civil servant and military professional intelligence professional who have across our government but what needed more than anything higher degree what argue strategic competence and thats the ability integrate the element national power that theyre applied way that are synergistic the whole greater than the sum the part time get right but most often get wrong and our approach these complex problem fragmented inconsistent mentioned you based flawed assumption about the nature the problem what would like see these day more concerted effort foster multinational cooperation write mean none these problem are solvable any country very important for create the right venue for come together not only work discrete issue event together but really about these complex challenge frame them together and then apply our competitive advantage between our like minded country that have synergistic effect and and that can build better future for generation come michael_morrell the last question anybody who listened the podcast this point going wow that hard tough list wonder the end the youre optimistic you are pessimistic that were going get this right going forward gen_mcmaster michael optimistic about optimistic about emerge this triple crisis the pandemic the recession associated with and the divide our society laid bare george floyds murder and the protest and civil unrest that followed whats great about our democracy are self correcting the american people have how theyre governed they can demand better and the reason wrote the american people understand these challenge they demand

that likely worsen the number fifth_generation aircraft grows the west heart texas air show there are seven european nato nation that operate plan buy the belgium denmark italy the netherlands and norway poland and those military ought collectively own more than example the stealth fighter this exceed the number fifth_generation aircraft stationed the european theater wide margin say the report the combined force possessed european ally likely approach aircraft and would represent roughly percent the combined fleet for plan acquire example sukhoi fifth_generation fighter jet moscow recently the such stealth aircraft would delivered december european allied air_force have around fourth_generation fighter comprising type such the dassault rafale eurofighter typhoon and lockheed martin the

opening phase conflict with vulnerability advanced ground based threat would constrain the role most fourth_generation and called fourth_generation plus platform say the report extensive integrated air defence threat persisted more advanced platform such the rafale eurofighter could theoretically perform strike mission inside the threat zone conjunction with fifth_generation platform although this approach could yield unacceptable attrition but with fourth_generation fighter likely still european nato air_force the alliance need find way better the aircraft the fast jet could used launch range missile strike beyond the range surface air missile and upgraded with active electronically scanned array aesa radar european fourth_generation fighter would more capable defence aesa radar can detect track and identify more target faster and longer distance note rand the resultant situational awareness and ability defeat multiple threat the same make aesa capability essential for aspect high intensity operation for example intercept cruise_missile say the tank report the french decision procure aesa for the rafale fighter informed the opportunity provide increase detection range low observable target and maximize the value weapon system such the meteor beyond visual range missile the mbda meteor active radar guided beyond visual range air air missile that reported have reach theory fourth_generation fighter like the rafale aesa radar and armed with beyond visual range missile like the meteor ought able see and hit incoming aircraft while staying out reach itself however beside the addition aesa the rafales other european fourth_generation aircraft lack the advanced radar uncertainty remain which nation invest aesa radar technology advanced and range munition and

communicate and pas targeting information with the link system add the report however this might vulnerability point reasonable assume that the military would seek disrupt this synergy during conflict particularly light recent investment capability rand say still european nato military are getting more practice with the already ally have undertaken initial step establish common tactic technique and procedure for incorporating fifth_generation asset into combined operation through targeted exercise preliminary synthetic training system that link fourth and fifth_generation aircraft the tank say the highest hurdle nato collaboration might investment aircraft readiness operationally relevant during theatre conflict nato air_force must maintain sufficient number available aircraft munition and aircrew say rand currently most european air_force maintain around half their existing fleet mission capable status with some ally falling below that mark what more fourth_generation aircraft are suffering rising maintenance cost platform age operational wear and tear resulting high operational tempo and challenge associated with spare part pipeline serve significant constraint aircraft

aircraft readiness problem making public data mission capable rate also suggests public agreement nato leader standard availability objective could provide renewed political and budgetary focus

russian that this restored and may ask you some question about other cultural people people relation between and america like sister_city program the business cooperation cooperation space arctic because there are lot dimension coexistence rather only all the military and strategic one konstantin you absolutely right and would you there are relation between the government and the government the federation whether strategic and military issue political issue and all how fraught those relation have been over the last several year particular but there broader relationship between the united_state and between our people cultural and educational exchange business space the arctic and small topic that like emphasize but colleague here the embassy are probably sick hearing talk about ice hockey which personal interest mine but those connection konstantin that are among the most significant that have and they are bond that keep together when the political situation seems most dire and thing observed tenure here how the relationship between the united_state and changed just professional lifetime you came mentioned earlier our conversation that visited st_petersburg private citizen had great interest and history visited moscow what then leningrad but visited the soviet_union then and visited leningrad not st_petersburg and you all that happened our relationship between our country over the last year how thing have changed the ups and down what grown been the cultural business all those tie between our people that have grown dramatically and that distinguishes this era that sort late soviet_era that grew the and when didn have those tie that keep together when the political sea get choppy for example have more than business invested doing business here and that mean russian and american working together not just the bolshoi traveling york and performing york city you equivalent theatre company coming the united_state and performing here personal interaction between colleague business and that significant and provides little more ballast for the relationship when the political sea can get choppy but those who are old enough with some perspective can look back over the last three four decade and see how our relationship changed our counterpart year the ambassador and your successor you sure they remarking too how thing have changed since and the relationship between the united_state and remember those dark old day with you with ukraine crimea and syria and libya and nagorno_karabakh and belarus and election interference and cyber this and god know what our successor are going talking about year but what the fact that have made the connection that made over the last year business the art sport and entertainment more likely that positive outcome and more positive development not just focused the negativity yeah you mentioned the amazing figure that thousand business are dealing with despite all the sanction and all the risk connected with sanction and our cooperation between military syria also exist and they exchange information really share your view that the infrastructure sphere interrelation good support these big politics and that you absolutely right that infrastructure something you mentioned konstantin sister_city partnership got large number this program that been existence for decade established and managed the government there official government relationship that involved here note sister_city international nonpartisan nonprofit which serf the national membership organization for individual sister_city county and state across the united_state sister_city international created president eisenhower white_house summit citizen diplomacy but independent nongovernmental organization end note but these sister_city relationship you date back into soviet time into the when the five sister_city relationship happened and you got city all across the united_state that are joined with city across sarasota florida and vladimir for example burlington vermont and yaroslavl louisville kentucky and perm chicago and moscow and you small thing but important our relationship and also the link with business konstantin because what done here the embassy and colleague the department commerce and our counterpart the ministry trade that have made connection business business connection with region and city

hundred virtual virtual event did zoom some other electronic mean which colleague are better able describe and function than just sit front the camera and talk but what fascinating for those student the american that they really had chance engage with their young life and had lot common talked about our legal education some their professor were the call and got share few comment about law professor and what like joining profession what their expectation were and just example our life both experienced this russian and american there are thing that have common whether engineer ballet dancer hockey player author lawyer people are people and the more that can have these exchange trade experience explore how our system are different and how they similar break down stereotype and just make thing between our country make the relationship stronger and make more difficult for political wind blow the relationship really dangerous direction the more understand each_other the better able overcome some these difference which would separate yeah thank_you ambassador you what noticed that what you talked today actually about the substance american relation because usually lot expert view

geopolitical issue which spend you the vast amount focused and you write about and all interested and they extremely important the world and global security and peace and prosperity but talking about the united_state and not just those issue and our relationship history joking with the deputy foreign minister titov were were talking about the arctic and commented the fact that have thank then the empire for giving the united_state stake the arctic selling alaska right our relationship back way when secretary state seward purchased alaska and made eventually the arctic council but shared laugh over that but just example over the united_state and have deal with each_other these political issue but broader level people people have stronger tie than did when growing the and and people people tie educational and forth the political issue are challenging and maybe more challenging some way than they were for predecessor year_ago when the soviet_union versus the west and the united_state but
