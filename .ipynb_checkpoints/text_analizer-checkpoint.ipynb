       "['u.s. presidents george w. bush and barack obama, when first elected, both thought they could establish a rapport with russian leader vladimir putin and dramatically improve u.s.-russian relations., their appraisal of putin swiftly changed., when asked his impression of putin after his first face-to-face meeting, george w. bush said, “i looked the man in the eye. i found him very straightforward and trustworthy – i was able to get a sense of his soul.” obama, eight years later, openly sought a reset in relations only to see his hopes dashed finally with russia’s annexation of the ukrainian peninsula crimea in 2014., joe biden, who as obama’s vice president supported the reset strategy, is unlikely to follow the example of his predecessors, say former diplomats and analysts. biden indicated as much during his presidential campaign, saying at a cnn town hall last month, “i believe russia is an opponent, i really do.”, in contrast, he called china “a competitor, a serious competitor.”, during the presidential campaign, biden sought to differentiate himself from president donald trump regarding russia, accusing his republican rival of being soft on putin., trump and his aides pushed back, with the president saying in august, “the last person russia wants to see in office is donald trump because nobody’s been tougher on russia than i have.”, early last month, biden criticized his opponent for remaining silent on the poisoning of russian opposition leader alexei navalny, which he bluntly blamed on the moscow government., “once again, the kremlin has used a favorite weapon — an agent from the novichok class of chemicals — in an effort to silence a political opponent,” he said. “it is the mark of a russian regime that is so paranoid that it is unwilling to tolerate any criticism or dissent.”, but candidates can say one thing during a campaign and do something else once in office; sometimes they have little choice because of circumstances or the course of events. will a president joe biden pursue as muscular an approach to russia as he has suggested?, \"“i dont think biden is going to fall head over heels to butter up putin,” said david kramer, who was an assistant secretary of state in the administration of george w. bush. “moscow has continued with a disinformation campaign against him, and so i dont think hes going to extend a hand and say, ‘lets make nice,’” added kramer, now a fellow at the mccain institute, a foreign policy think tank based in washington.\", “i mean, no reset. i don’t think he’s going to try anything like 2009,” kramer said in reference to obama’s failed reset policy. kramer thinks biden will have to focus largely on domestic issues, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact., \"“and to the extent he is able to focus on foreign policy, russia should not be at the high end of the priority list,” he told voa. although he added, “you cant ignore it. and it is a factor in a number of problems we face. i think hes going to have to devote his limited time when it comes to foreign policy to work with countries that are ready to solve problems.” by that he means shoring up america’s transatlantic alliance.\", biden and putin have met — without much cordiality. in a 2011 interview with ,  magazine, biden said at one meeting he told the russian leader, “i’m looking into your eyes, and i don’t think you have a soul.”, biden continued: “he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said: ‘we understand one another.’”, aside from the lack of personal rapport, analysts say any effort to reset relations would be complicated by economic sanctions on russia, imposed by both the obama and trump administrations. the measures will leave biden with little room to maneuver and are unlikely to be lifted while western powers believe russia is mounting cyberattacks against them., former western diplomats say antagonism is likely to persist between washington and moscow as long as the kremlin seeks to undermine western democratic institutions., last week, a former top security adviser to british prime minister boris johnson, mark sedwill, revealed that britain has launched a series of covert cyber-based attacks on russian leaders and their interests to “impose a price greater than one they might have expected” for their cyber-offensive against the west., other allied powers, including the u.s. are doing so, too, say western intelligence officials in what is becoming a “like-for-like” cyber-conflict with the kremlin in the so-called “gray space,” the gap between normal state relations and armed conflict., the u.s. and other western powers are in conflict with russia on a range of issues — from the 2014 annexation of crimea to the pro-moscow agitation in east ukraine, from russia’s backing of syria’s president bashar al-assad to the 2018 attempted assassination in salisbury, england, of former russian double agent sergei skripal., heather williams of britain’s chatham house expects a biden administration to focus on two key areas: restoring arms control and strengthening nato to check russian adventurism., “on the one hand, the u.s. must maintain a strong deterrent and restore credibility with its allies. at the same time, it must pursue arms control and other risk reduction opportunities,” she said., in the final days of the presidential election the kremlin appeared to be hedging its bets on who might win., republican campaigners, as well as president trump, had been hurling corruption charges at biden’s son hunter over his service on the board of an energy company in ukraine and business dealings with china., but putin dodged an opportunity to amplify the allegations against hunter biden, saying, “yes, in ukraine he had or maybe still has a business. it doesn’t concern us. it concerns the americans and the ukrainians. i don’t see anything criminal about this.”, the russian leader has also sought to highlight possible common ground with biden — especially over nuclear arms control., putin called this month for the last existing nuclear arms control pact between russia and the u.s. to be saved, proposing to extend the new start treaty that’s set to expire in february. “it would be extremely sad if the treaty ceases to exist,” he said., the treaty was signed in 2010 by barack obama and then-russian president dmitry medvedev. the pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers., during his long career in the senate, biden was a champion of nuclear arms control and he has promised to seek to extend the new start treaty, saying he would likely accept a russian offer to extend it for five years.][\\\\n, \\\\n, as a candidate, joe biden said he would reverse many of the foreign-policy initiatives of the trump administration, such as withdrawing the united states from international agreements, and work to repair the transatlantic relationship that he contends has been the key to stability in europe over the past 75 years., he has said he would take a tougher stand on russia, expressed strong support for ukraine, and would rejoin the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran, if tehran holds up its end of the deal., a former vice president and senator who served nearly 50 years in washington, biden believes the united states can best tackle global threats by leading alliances of democratic states., he said he would take \"immediate steps\" upon entering office to strengthen alliances \"and once more have america lead the world.\", however, biden will be faced with major domestic problems in a deeply divided country -- including the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, racial tension, and growing inequality -- that may prompt him to put his foreign-policy initiatives on the back burner, analysts say., analysts have said it could take the biden administration several months to put together its entire foreign policy team and set more specific priorities., biden has said he would seek to repair transatlantic ties, which he asserts president donald trump has damaged by repeatedly criticizing the european union and nato, slapping tariffs on some european goods, and withdrawing from international agreements., in contrast to trump, who in 2016 called nato \"obsolete,\" biden has called it the \"most effective political-military alliance in modern history\" and said it must remain strоng while adapting to new kinds of threats from russia., \"to counter russian aggression, we must keep the alliance\\\\s military capabilities sharp while also expanding its capacity to take on nontraditional threats, such as weaponized corruption, disinformation, and cybertheft,\" he wrote in the journal ,  earlier in 2020, in an article setting out his positions on a range of issues., biden has said he would take a tougher stand against russian president vladimir putin, and has called moscow an \"opponent\" as well as the biggest \"threat\" to the security of the united states today., he has criticized the kremlin for actions including the seizure of crimea and for its role in the war between kyiv and russia-backed separatists in ukraine’s donbas region. he has also accused it of interfering in u.s. elections and of being behind attacks on russian journalists and civil society leaders. trump rarely criticized the kremlin., \"unlike trump, i\\\\ll defend our democratic values and stand up to autocrats like putin,\" biden said in a tweet in august., \"he has also threatened to punish moscow if it interfered in the 2020 election and rejected trumps idea of inviting russia back into the group of seven (g7) leading industrialized countries.\", \"we must impose real costs on russia for its violations of international norms and stand with russian civil society, which has bravely stood up time and again against...putin\\\\s kleptocratic authoritarian system,\" he wrote in the foreign affairs article., biden supports the cancelation of the kremlin-backed nord stream 2 pipeline to carry natural gas from russia to germany. opponents of the pipeline say it would deprive ukraine of significant transit fees from russia and increase european reliance on russian energy exports., \"biden, who was obamas point man on ukraine as vice president, has expressed strong support for ukraines independence and integration with europe and has backed sending lethal weapons to kyiv to help it battle the russian-backed separatists.\", \"biden has said he would extend new start, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with russia, while pursuing negotiations on a new pact. new start, which imposes limits on the two countries strategic nuclear arsenals, expires in february but can be extended by up to five years by mutual agreement.\", \"the trump administration has rejected moscows proposal to prolong new start with no additional conditions, as well as an offer for a one-year extension, and has not reached an agreement on its extension. biden argues that the pact is beneficial to u.s. security and should be extended while a new agreement is sought.\", \"while bidens positions on putin and russias actions suggest that tensions between washington and moscow will remain tense and could potentially worsen once he takes office, arms control is one of a handful of issues that analysts say could present a platform for productive negotiations between the united states and the kremlin. \", biden has said that he would have the united states rejoin the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran, which curbed the country’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief -- if tehran moves back into compliance with its terms., \"iran violated the terms of the agreement with global powers after trump withdrew the united states from the deal known as the jcpoa in 2018 and imposed sanctions on tehran. the sanctions have hurt irans economy but not promoted it to seek a new deal.\", biden has said he would work with the other powers involved -- britain, france, germany, russia, and china, as well as the eu -- to amend aspects of the agreement once iran is back in compliance., \"with our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal\\\\s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern,\" such as human rights violations and the jailing of foreigners, biden said., biden said he would bring u.s. troops home from afghanistan -- almost 20 years after the united states led an invasion to drive the taliban extremist group from power following the september 11 attacks in 2001 -- and leave in place only a small contingent of special forces who would carry out counterterrorism missions., biden opposed the large buildup of u.s. troops in afghanistan while serving as vice president from 2009 to 2017., barring substantial developments before his inauguration on january 20, he will inherit a historic but fragile peace process that the trump administration set in motion by reaching a political deal with the taliban in february 2020 that paved the road for peace talks between the militants and the u.s.-backed afghan government., biden has said he will work with u.s. allies to strengthen democracies around the world and push back on creeping authoritarianism. he has expressed concern over what is widely seen as a rollback of democracy in some nato member states, including poland and hungary., \"during my first year in office, the united states will organize and host a global \\\\summit for democracy\\\\ to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the free world. it will bring together the world\\\\s democracies to strengthen our democratic institutions, honestly confront nations that are

maria v. zakharova, said. “this is partially explained by the archaic legal code and its ambiguity on key matters, as we have said more than once.”, but the images on russian television of poll workers across america diligently counting ballots may have told their own story about how a democracy functions., critics of the kremlin have next to no ability to use the television airwaves, so

appearance. , visit the velvety slopes dipping down to russia’s verdant black sea coast, and you will see that this applies even to wine., vladimir prokhorov, bespectacled and profane, has been making wine from the grapes bulging off the vines for 30 years. he has never been abroad, let alone to portugal, but his madeira is magical. his cellar is his shrine, where an icon of jesus sits next to the thermometer, and where he and his wife never set foot when they are in a bad mood., but the oak barrels — marked in chalk “2016 muscat hamburg,” “2016 cahors” — now make a hollow sound when you tap them. the police showed up last summer at his winery in southern russia and drained them all., “i hate them,” mr. prokhorov said, referring to the authorities, slamming his left fist into his right palm. “i hate them with a fierce loathing.”, on first glance, the rebirth of russian fine winemaking, catering to well-off russians’ more refined tastes, is a putin-era success story. but beyond the vines, a darker and very russian tale of big dreams, dashed hopes, bureaucratic nightmares and police raids comes into view., many of russia’s smallest and most innovative winemakers, with the informal approval of local officials, long operated without licenses, considering them prohibitively cumbersome and expensive. then, about two years ago, the federal authorities started cracking down, bringing the easy boom years of the country’s upstart vintners to an end., russia covers almost seven million square miles of territory, most of it frozen year-round, and much of the soil yielding little except cloudberries, lingonberries and ,  poking out of the thawing ground., but then there is a sliver, from the caucasus foothills to crimea, where the softly undulating, deep-green land, glowing beneath the warm autumn sun, is reminiscent of a tuscan afternoon. the ancient greeks made wine around here, and so did the czars, who brought in french expertise., the soviets collectivized the vineyards and turned winemaking into industrial-scale enterprises like that chateau of the proletariat, kubanvinogradagroprom., in wine-rich areas like the resort city of anapa, there were once ,  dispensing chilled riesling by the cupful. at home, in their basements, people finessed their own small-batch techniques., nowadays, the black sea coast is an oenophile’s dreamland, attracting people from across the country who want to try making their own wine in its rocky soil. most of the major european grape varieties, along with obscure soviet-developed ones and indigenous types like krasnostop zolotovsky, are grown here., to president vladimir v. putin, restoring the czarist-era glory days of russian winemaking meshes with his mission to make russia great again. kremlin-allied oligarchs have poured millions of dollars into elite russian vineyards, and one of mr. putin’s propaganda chiefs, the television host dmitri kiselyov, became the head of the country’s winemaking association last year., so it makes sense that a section of the annual agricultural fair in russia’s southern breadbasket region, krasnodar krai, is devoted to wine. but there was something odd in the cavernous convention hall in krasnodar, the region’s main metropolis, when i visited the fair in early october:, the men peddling their merlots and sauvignon blancs seemed very wary of journalists., by way of explanation, andrei greshnov, a former moscow banker, pointed to his bottles. there were no excise stamps, typically required for alcohol sold in russia., getting licensed for making and selling wine had long been too costly for small-scale producers like mr. greshnov. so he and dozens of others operated outside the law, with a wink and a nod from local officials, who saw them as part of the region’s identity and also drank their wines. but in the last two years, russia’s federal law enforcement authorities have intruded on these arrangements., “we understood that these were green shoots that needed to be supported,” emil minasov, a senior official in the krasnodar region’s agriculture ministry, said of the unlicensed winemakers. “they were able to strike deals with local administrations to be left alone. now this has become impossible. they’ve been squeezed, to put it bluntly.”, law enforcement officials say they are combating tax avoidance and counterfeit and unsanitary production, which are indeed problems in russia. recent changes in the law are supposed to make it easier for small wineries to be legal., but mr. minasov calculates that wineries still need to produce at least 40,000 bottles a year just to cover the expense — $6,000 at a minimum — of getting licensed and, more problematically, of keeping up with the reams of building regulations and reporting requirements. he added that he believes small-scale wineries should not be required to be licensed at all, “but they don’t listen to us up above.”, on a hillside by the sea, ivan karakezidi, a descendant of greeks who goes by yannis, was on the phone with yet another lawyer. since the 1990s, mr. karakezidi, 64, has been one of the region’s best-known small-batch vintners and entertainers, hosting parties on his sprawling compound, which evokes a mediterranean village. , the police swooped in on the compound at 6 a.m. on a june morning, climbing over the fence, he says, and seized 4,545 high-end bottles, including his prized 2003 cabernet sauvignon. his son faces jail time, allegedly caught in a sting operation for selling unlicensed wine. mr. karakezidi insists he is the victim of a scheme by well-connected businesspeople to gain control of his choice vineyards., if his legal woes deepen, he is prepared to leave the country. “it’s counterproductive to do business here,” mr. karakezidi said. “no matter what, they will convict you, lock you up, take it all away and envy you.”, before he leaves, he will show those who take over his property “where the tasting room is and where the toilet is, so they don’t get them mixed up.”, some small winemakers have managed to get licensed, but they question whether they will be able to make a living., olga and vadim berdyayev’s breezy courtyard on the outskirts of anapa was suffused on a recent afternoon with the rich, yeasty scent of fermenting grapes. a neighbor helped them pour buckets of cabernet franc into a press while mr. berdyayev, in his garage lined with steel vats, checked the density of this year’s riesling in a test tube., the couple, both architects, brewed beer in their home region, siberia, and discovered winemaking when they moved to the black sea coast 12 years ago. making a wine is like raising a child, ms. berdyayeva said: sometimes it gets sick, and you have to treat it, and sometimes it shows talent, “and you start to marvel and wonder.”, they sold at fairs and to travelers on winery tours. but two years ago it became clear the good times were over: the government let it be known that even the tiniest wineries had to get licenses. that meant spending around $7,000 on paperwork, ventilation and a specialized scanner for excise stamps; submitting to strict controls and inspections; and tracking every bottle produced with specialized government software and unique 19-digit codes., ms. berdyayeva quit her job to focus on the bureaucracy, and the couple got their license. but rather than being comforted, mr. berdyayev says he now lives in constant fear of inspections or a paperwork mistake. his stress echoed the cri de coeur of many russians struggling with the unchecked power of

that the bureau has seen “very active efforts by the russians to influence our election in 2020” – mainly involving misinformation with the primary goal of denigrating joe biden. and the us indictment of six russian military intelligence hackers last week served as a reminder of the potential threat., however, as biden enters the final days of the campaign with a significant lead, putin appears to be hedging his bets. the russian president pointedly declined to amplify donald trump’s ,  about biden’s son, hunter, and his past business dealings in ukraine, noting he did not “see anything criminal” in them. putin has also pointed to possible common ground with the democrats on social democratic ideology and arms control., the russian leader and the former vice-president certainly know each other well from past encounters, though the relationship lacks any of the warmth that trump claims infuses his bond with the russian leader., “i’m looking into your eyes, and i don’t think you have a soul,” biden told putin at a 2011 meeting, according to an account he , . “he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said: ‘we understand one another.’”, biden has not dwelled on the well-worn topics of trump’s soft spot for putin or kremlin meddling – in part because coronavirus has cast such a long shadow over the election and the biden team feel that voters are tired of hearing about , ., “the most resonant issues for american voters right now are trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, and the dangers of white nationalism; by contrast, russian election interference in 2016 seems more distant for those just trying to make ends meet,” said michael carpenter, a foreign policy adviser during biden’s time as vice-president who remains in touch with the campaign., it is possible, too, that “russiagate” was never a major vote-winning issue: trump’s supporters dismissed the charges as “fake news” and many of his opponents were more focused on other issues., “russia is a media and a washington conversation. my students don’t care about russia; they care about black lives matter and metoo,” said nina khrushcheva, a russian-american professor of international affairs at the new school in new york., questions over the business dealings of biden’s son in ukraine have failed to resonate much beyond trump’s core base, with ,  of biden’s alleged wrongdoing in ukraine largely falling flat., if moscow did indeed , , their man has done little to improve the the bilateral relationship over the past four years, despite his personal praise for putin. but ,  and naked america-first self-interest is something that the kremlin appreciates – and may explain why officials in moscow want to see trump win a second term., “putin and people around him might like trump because he fits very nicely with their view of the world. he’s a graphic illustration of their logic that the world is moving away from liberal values and multilateralism and towards sovereignty and traditional values,” said andrey kortunov, of the russian international affairs council., he said that while putin genuinely does not understand politicians such as angela merkel or emmanuel macron – and believes their talk of values to be hollow and cynical – with trump there is a recognition of a kindred spirit, even if there is little affection for him as a person. the two men share “scepticism of international bodies, emphasis on sovereignty, a transactionalist approach to foreign policy and a feeling that discussions about values are mere hypocrisy”, said kortunov., putin earlier this month noted biden’s history of “sharp anti-russian rhetoric” and contrasted it with trump’s oft-stated desire for better ties with moscow., “biden’s approach to russia would involve supporting a dialogue on arms control, strategic stability, crisis management and risk reduction from a position of strength,” said carpenter, saying it was simplistic to see the question of russia policy as a black-and-white hawk or dove calculation., kortunov said that russia, unlike germany, israel or china, is in the “privileged position” that the outcome of the election is likely to have little effect on bilateral relations. “but the bad news is that this is because it will be bad either way. almost anything that could be broken is already broken,” he said. and there is little prospect of improvement., kirill dmitriev, the head of russia’s sovereign wealth fund, who was ,  for informal contacts with members of the trump entourage after his 2016 victory, declined to say whether he favoured a trump or biden victory. but he said either way it was hard to imagine how things could get worse. “we are at the lowest point ever in the history of us-russian relations so going even lower would be difficult,” he said., russia still denies all accusations of meddling in the 2016 election, whether it be the hacking of democratic party servers or armies of internet trolls stirring up trouble on facebook and twitter., but , , who was the national security council director for european and russian affairs for three years of the trump administration and testified at trump’s impeachment hearing, said hawkish russian security official nikolai patrushev and other top officials all but admitted russia’s interference in the 2016 vote when she confronted them., “the russians said to us: ‘you guys left yourselves open.’ they were admitting it essentially. they said it’s on you that this got so out of hand.”, the officials suggested that the us had left russia an open goal with its divisive politics – and she felt they had a point: “we were providing the raw materials, making our own mistakes,” she said. the russian interference “wouldn’t have resonated without our deep polarisation and our structural issues”., this time round, there are new allegations of russian attempts to influence the political landscape, such as ,  apparently set up by russians

][yerevan, armenia (ap) — russia’s top diplomat said tuesday that about 2,000 fighters from the middle east have joined the fighting over nagorno-karabakh, the worst outbreak of hostilities in the conflict between armenia and azerbaijan in more than a quarter-century., russian foreign minister sergey lavrov’s statement came as the warring parties traded accusations over new attacks in the region., “we are certainly worried about the internationalization of the nagorno-karabakh conflict and the involvement of militants from the middle east,” lavrov said in an interview with the russian business daily kommersant. “we have repeatedly asked foreign players to use their potential to stop the transfer of militants, whose number in the conflict zone is approaching 2,000.”, lavrov added that russian president vladimir putin raised the issue in last week’s phone call with turkish president recep tayyip erdogan., nagorno-karabakh lies within azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic armenian forces backed by armenia since a war there ended in 1994. the latest outburst of hostilities began sept. 27 and has left hundreds — perhaps thousands — dead, marking the worst escalation of fighting since the war’s end., azerbaijan has relied on strong support from its ally turkey, which has trained azerbaijani military and provided it with strike drones and long-range rocket systems. armenian officials accuse turkey of being directly involved in the conflict and sending mercenaries from syria to fight on azerbaijan’s side. , turkey has denied deploying combatants to the region, but a syrian war monitor and syria-based opposition activists have confirmed that turkey has sent hundreds of syrian opposition fighters to fight in nagorno-karabakh., the heavy fighting involving heavy artillery, rockets and drones has raged despite repeated international attempts to end hostilities. a u.s.-brokered truce frayed immediately after it took effect last week, just like two previous cease-fires negotiated by russia, and the latest pledge by armenia and azerbaijan not to target residential areas was broken hours after it was made friday. the warring sides

nagorno-karabakh and pressed their offensive into the separatist territory from the south, trying to cut a link between the separatist territory and armenia., lavrov said that russia was continuing to push for hostilities to end, noting that it’s working on a set of verification measures needed to achieve a lasting cease-fire, including the possible deployment of international observers under the

to eat., the fields are planted with beets. the town is named borshchiv, which means “belonging to borscht.” it is just one of a dozen cities and villages in ukraine named for borscht., given this clear commitment to borscht, ukrainians wonder why the soup is commonly assumed to be russian, a national dish of their archenemy., now a ukrainian chef supported by the ,  and parliament is trying to set the record straight with an application to the united nations’ cultural body, unesco, to list borscht as an intangible part of ukraine’s cultural heritage., “they can think whatever they like, but borscht is a ukrainian soup,” said olha habro, a grandmother and well-practiced maker of borscht in borshchiv., like the food fight between the arabs and israelis over who owns hummus, the dispute sadly divides two neighboring cultures over traditions that might have united them. borscht is enjoyed in both ukraine and russia., this conflict, though, comes with a twist. even some russian culinary historians and authoritative soviet-era reference books on food place the origin of borscht in ukraine. but after the soviet union broke up, russia seemed to stake more of its own claim to the soup., a year ago, the russian government ,  in english on its twitter account a recipe proclaiming that “borscht is one of russia’s most famous and beloved dishes.”, for the chef, , , it was the last straw. he had already been upset, he said, when friends told him that stores and restaurants in europe and the united states market borscht as a russian soup., “a lot of things were taken away from ukraine, but they will not take our borscht,” he said, adding, “i understood we have to defend what is ours.”, he went to battle, creating a ,  to assert ukraine’s sovereignty over borscht. the group spent months painstakingly gathering evidence that the dish originated in ukraine and planned cultural events celebrating it, including taking a giant caldron around the country to cook borscht at festivals., ukraine plans to submit the unesco application in march. parliament has passed a resolution in support., to win recognition from the united nations cultural body, the ukrainians do not have to show that borscht is exclusive to their country, only that it is tightly entwined with their culture in such things as wedding and funeral traditions. and they must show that the soup is consumed widely. town names also count., the borscht dispute highlights deeper grievances between ukraine and russia., ukrainians see the russian government, in addition to pursuing a military intervention in their country, as trying to appropriate the entire cultural heritage of the eastern slavic world for moscow, on such issues as leadership in the orthodox church and historical claims to crimea., in western countries, borscht came to be viewed as russian in part because of the tendency for many decades to conflate russia, which was only one of the soviet republics, with all things soviet., at home, many soviet cookbooks identified borscht as ukrainian, including an ,  of ethnic cooking published in 1978, “national cuisines of our people,” which listed six recipes, all from regions of ukraine., even the soviet , , “the book of tasty and healthy food,” first published in 1939 under stalin, does not describe borscht as russian. it has only one recipe for the soup indicating a national origin, and that is for “ukrainian borscht.” the others are specialized versions with mushrooms or low in fat, of unspecified origin., to be fair, russia also has a dozen villages and towns named for borscht, each with its own recipe, and the soup is on the menu at any restaurant serving russian cuisine. nobody disputes that russians today eat plenty of borscht., but it is a relatively modern addition to the russian menu, said olga a. syutkina, a russian culinary historian and author of “the true history of russian cuisine.”, it spread widely in central russia starting in the late 18th century, she said, in part because the soup was easily made in large batches and served by the tsarist military. later, it became a staple in cafeterias in soviet factories., “the association with the soviet epoch creates the illusion that borscht is an inalienable part of the russian menu,” ms. syutkina said., adding to the confusion, russians seeking to lay claim to borscht’s origins sometimes cite an entirely different soup that was made in medieval times in russia from wild hogweed grass and a light beer made from fermented bread. it, too, was called borscht, and is mentioned in a 16th-century moscow book of advice about home life, “homemaker.”, in rural ukraine, gardens yield all the ingredients. for the winter, ukrainians preserve sour sorrel leaves in canning jars as a base for green borscht, a version without beets. for funeral wakes, vegetarian borscht is on the menu., more typically, it is a meaty broth, sometimes so rich a quarter inch or so of glistening, liquid fat shimmers on the surface., in borshchiv recently, ms. habro made a pot for her son, who had been working in the garden planting garlic, and for her grandson, who had been at best only pretending to help with the garden chores but wasn’t begrudged a bowl of soup all the same., a secret of borscht is accounting for the different cooking times of the ingredients, typically beetroot, carrots, beans, potatoes and some sort of meat, usually beef, but sometimes pork or chicken. ms. habro uses two pots — the meat, beans and potatoes in one, the beets and carrots in the other — mixing the two just before serving., last month russia seemed to back down — a rarity these days — on any claim of a direct sphere of influence over the soup. “borscht is a national food of many countries, including russia, belarus, ukraine, poland, romania, moldova and lithuania,” the russian embassy in washington , . “choose your favorite.”, the post did include a video of a recipe for “russian borscht,” by a division of the russian information agency, a state news outlet at times accused of influence operations. it was a version built on beef bouillon with potatoes, spiced with black pepper, which appeared tasty enough., anton a. alyoshin, head chef at clever, a culinary school in moscow, said the more traditional russian soups use sauerkraut rather than fresh cabbage, reflecting the tradition of preserving vegetables for the long, harsh northern winters. the result is a delightful pork and sauerkraut soup — shchi — that is more indisputably russia’s own. it is also served with sour cream, but, sadly, is not well-known outside russia., “by the culinary canon, borscht is a ukrainian tradition,” mr. alyoshin said, surrendering without a fight. “if we talk about shchi, a similar dish, it is more russian.”, he clarified that borscht “is a dish with a tremendously long history” that has been made in russia for generations, and said that he and countless other russian cooks enjoy stewing pots of borscht., “to be honest, borscht is a slavic national dish: it is russian and ukrainian,” he said. “the roots are the same, but politics interfered.”,

arms control agreement that would also include china. moscow has described that idea as unfeasible, pointing at beijing’s refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its much-smaller nuclear arsenal., putin on friday proposed to “extend the existing treaty without any conditions for at least one year\" to allow for “substantive talks,” instructing russian foreign minister sergey lavrov to get a quick u.s. answer to the offer. he emphasized that russia is ready to discuss the new weapons it deployed in future arms talks with the united states., earlier this week, lavrov voiced skepticism about reaching a deal on new start, noting that russia can’t accept the conditions put forward by the united states for its extension., lavrov specified that russia can’t agree to the u.s. proposal to limit battlefield nuclear weapons alongside nuclear warheads that arm strategic missiles and bombers until the u.s. agrees to withdraw its tactical nuclear weapons from europe., he also noted that moscow wouldn’t accept the u.s. demand to have intrusive verification measures like those that existed in the 1990s when inspectors were positioned at missile factories., lavrov’s pessimistic view contrasted with statements from u.s. diplomats, who said that moscow and washington were close to a deal., “we would welcome the opportunity to complete an agreement based on

while senior trump administration officials ,  that iran has been actively interfering in the presidential election, many intelligence officials said they remained far more concerned about russia, which in recent days has hacked into state and local computer networks in breaches that could allow moscow broader access to american voting infrastructure., the discovery of the hacks came as american intelligence agencies, infiltrating russian networks themselves, have pieced together details of what they believe are russia’s plans to interfere in the presidential race in its final days or immediately after the election on nov. 3. officials did not make clear what russia planned to do, but they said its operations would be intended to help president trump, potentially by exacerbating disputes around the results, especially if the race is too close to call., f.b.i. and homeland security officials also ,  on thursday that russia’s state hackers had targeted dozens of state and local governments and aviation networks starting in september. they stole data from the computer servers of at least two unidentified targets and continued to crawl through some of the affected networks, the agencies said. other officials said that the targets included some voting-related systems, and that they may have been collateral damage in the attacks., so far, there is no evidence that the russians have changed any vote tallies or voter registration information, officials said. they added that the russian-backed hackers had penetrated the computer networks without taking further action, as they did in 2016., but american officials expect that if the presidential race is not called on election night, russian groups could use their knowledge of the local computer systems to deface websites, release nonpublic information or take similar steps that could sow chaos and doubts about the integrity of the results, according to officials briefed on the intelligence. such steps could fuel mr. trump’s unsubstantiated claims that the vote is “rigged” and that he can be defeated only if his opponents cheat., some u.s. intelligence officials view russia’s intentions as more significant than the ,  on wednesday night by the director of national intelligence, john ratcliffe, that iran has been involved in the spread of faked, threatening emails, which were made to appear as if they came from the proud boys, a right-wing extremist group., the treasury department on thursday ,  against iraj masjedi, a former general in iran’s revolutionary guard corps and the country’s ambassador to iraq. the department said general masjedi had overseen training of pro-iranian militia groups in iraq and directed groups responsible for killing american forces there., officials briefed on the intelligence said that mr. ratcliffe had accurately summarized the preliminary conclusion about iran. but tehran’s hackers may have accomplished that mission simply by assembling public information and then routing the threatening emails through estonia, saudi arabia and other countries to hide their tracks. one official compared the iranian action to playing single a baseball, while the russians are major leaguers., nonetheless, the iranian and the russian activity could pave the way for so-called perception hacks, which are intended to leave the impression that foreign powers have greater access to the voting system than they really do. federal officials have warned for months that small breaches could be exaggerated to prompt inaccurate charges of widespread voter fraud., officials say russia’s ability to change vote tallies nationwide would be difficult, given how disparate american elections are. the graver concern is the potential effect of any attack on a few key precincts in battleground states., russian hackers recently obtained access “in a couple limited cases, to election jurisdiction, an election-related network,” christopher c. krebs, the director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, said on thursday. but he was careful to note that the breaches had “nothing to do with the casting and counting” of votes., the hackers, believed to be operating at the behest of russia’s federal security service, the f.s.b. — the successor agency to the soviet-era k.g.b. — infiltrated dozens of state and local computer networks in recent weeks, according to officials and researchers. but mr. krebs said the attacks appeared to be “opportunistic” in nature, a scattershot break-in of vulnerable systems rather than an attempt to zero in on key battleground states., but officials were alarmed by the combination of the targets, the timing — the attacks began less than two months ago — and the adversary, which is known for burrowing inside the supply chain of critical infrastructure that russia may want to take down in the future., the officials fear that russia could change, delete or freeze voter registration or pollbook data, making it harder for voters to cast ballots, invalidating mail-in ballots or creating enough uncertainty to undermine results., “it’s reasonable to assume any attempt at the election systems could be for the same purpose,” said john hultquist, the director of threat analysis at fireeye, a security firm that has been tracking the russian group’s foray into state and local systems. “this could be the reconnaissance for disruptive activity.”, mr. krebs said so far russia was not as active as iran, and its targeting was imprecise. “they’re broadly looking to scan for vulnerabilities, and they’re working opportunistically,” he said., current and former officials said there was little doubt that russia remained a greater threat and questioned why the focus was on iran on wednesday night, though they acknowledged that tehran’s interference was real and troubling., administration officials said the news conference reflected the urgency of the intelligence about iran. but some saw politics at play: mr. ratcliffe’s focus on iran would potentially benefit mr. trump politically., “it is concerning to me that the administration is willing to talk about what the iranians are doing — supposedly to hurt trump — than what the russians are likely doing to help him,” said jeh c. johnson, a former secretary of homeland security in the obama administration. “if the russians have in fact breached voter registration data, then the american people deserve to know from their government what it believes the russians are doing with that data.”, a senior official briefed on the intelligence said american spy agencies had been tracking the iranian group responsible for the spoofed emails for some time. as a result, the government was able to quickly debunk the falsified proud boys emails and identify iran as the culprit., iran’s hackers appear to have scanned or penetrated some state and local networks, government officials said on thursday. but security experts said the proud boys email campaign that the government attributed to iran did not appear to be based on hacked materials and instead relied on publicly available information that florida officials regularly distribute., “this was an email sent from a nonexistent domain using publicly available information,” said kevin o’brien, the chief executive of greathorn, a cybersecurity firm. “there was no hack here. your name, your party affiliation, your address and email address are all, generally speaking, public information.”, mr. o’brien said the information presented publicly ,  that iran was culpable., speaker nancy pelosi also voiced skepticism of mr. ratcliffe’s announcement. “russia is the villain here,” she said before a briefing from intelligence officials. “from what we have seen in the public domain, iran is a bad actor, but in no way equivalent.”, so far, the f.s.b.’s hackers have not focused on swing states, where a hack that affects digital disenfranchisement could have maximum effect; they have taken a scattershot approach instead, hitting systems in multiple states, including some battlegrounds. experts said they might be just testing to see where they could get in, like a thief trying every doorknob in the neighborhood., “my concern is not that they are pinpointing individual races but are gaining access where they can for some disruption down the road,” mr. hultquist said., the threat is similar to the one that officials have highlighted from ransomware attacks, which hold data hostage until victims pay to have access restored. likewise, officials and researchers believe the russian attacks would not necessarily change vote tallies but could make voter data inaccessible, or delete or change voters’ registration data, to disenfranchise voters or cause the kind of confusion and delays that would undermine american confidence in the election., in recent years, homeland security officials have made a concerted effort to secure voter registration systems and to ensure that election officials have paper copies of voter information in case of disruptions., but they have further to go. in gainesville, ga., this week, a ransomware attack held city systems hostage, including an online map with polling locations and the database used to verify voters’ signatures on mail-in ballots., officials and experts believe the greatest defense against a coordinated cyberattack on the election is not so much how secure these voting system are but how disparate., “you can’t just ‘hit the election’,” said eric chien, a cybersecurity director at symantec, now part of broadcom, which was among the first to detail the stuxnet attacks by the united states and israel on iran’s nuclear program a decade ago. “the soft targets are really the state and local election committees, local websites that provide information about polling places and hold voter registration data.”, alan rappeport and zolan kanno-youngs contributed reporting., advertisement][if you enjoyed reading this, subscribe for more!, we have been through a time of casting away stones. now is a time to gather stones together.” —senior russian federation official, chechnya, 1995, since shortly after the soviet union’s collapse, russia’s aims and policies in the south caucasus have been constant, but its capabilities to project power and influence have fluctuated.,  russia’s engagement with the entire caucasus region is best characterized as a tide. its power and influence began to ebb at the start of the karabakh conflict—with the february 1988 massacre of armenians in the azerbaijani city of sumqayit being the key galvanizing event.,  after that, the tide receded rapidly, leaving even russian possessions in the north caucasus without effective central control. the first chechen war marked low tide, which only began to rise with the second chechen war, beginning in 1999. until about 2004, russia was too weak and internally divided to project power and influence in the wider caucasus region in a meaningful way., to be sure, russian influence was never gone completely, even during the lowest ebb of the tide. russia still marshaled greater resources than the new states of the caucasus could muster, and it threw its weight around. but in the 1990s, russia did not have a unified governing apparatus, but rather a mass of competing clans among which regional actors could maneuver. for example, after the soviet collapse, moscow left the russian military units in the caucasus to their own devices. those units served as mercenaries, arms suppliers, and logistics providers to both sides in the karabakh conflict. it took a decade for moscow to reassert its so-called power vertical in the caucasus, symbolized by president vladimir putin’s success in 2004 in finally ousting chief of the general staff anatoliy kvashnin.,  russia’s assertiveness in the region grew steadily thereafter, with sharp upticks after the 2008 war with georgia and putin’s return to the presidency in 2012., but while moscow has gained the capacity to project more power and influence, the regional landscape has changed. the surge in fighting over nagornyy karabakh that began in late september 2020 has demonstrated that russia is struggling to contend with a vastly more complicated landscape. more external actors are on the scene, most notably turkey, and all three south caucasus states—armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia—have adapted their strategies to deal with the new environment. russia’s increased efforts have had decidedly mixed results., three factors were evident when the soviet union collapsed and continue today, narrowing russian policy options in the region., armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia are all radically different, with varying attitudes toward russia and moscow’s rule throughout the imperial and soviet eras. for centuries, armenia has sought russia’s protection against turkey and iran, which ruled most of the armenian historic homelands.,  this security concern was paramount in the immediate aftermath of the soviet collapse: the soviet army had disappeared, leaving the turkish third army as the most potent military force in the wider region. for its part, post-soviet russia views armenia as its closest friend in the region. a large and influential armenian diaspora in russia has maintained those positive feelings., azerbaijani elites, russified by the oil boom of the late nineteenth century, have largely been friendly to russia. thanks to former president heydar aliyev—who rose through the ranks of the soviet kgb and neither feared nor hated the post-soviet rulers of russia—a generally positive attitude toward russia survived the nationalisms of the years immediately following the soviet collapse. though post-soviet russia was initially suspicious of the expansion of turkish and western influence in azerbaijan, russia has since forged close energy relations with turkey. in the early period, these commercial relations took precedence in the russia-turkey relationship. more recently, as detailed later in the paper, the increasing ambiguity of russian-turkish relations has complicated russia’s relations with azerbaijan., armenia and azerbaijan have incorporated friendly relations with russia into a wider strategy: former armenian foreign minister vartan oskanian described it as a multivectoral approach, in which “foreign policy vectors point in different directions.”,  it entails seeking close relations with and assistance from powers other than russia, primarily the united states and the european union (eu). large armenian diasporas in the united states and france have aided this endeavor. in contrast, a poor record on democracy and human rights, as well as the armenian diaspora’s efforts in the united states, have hobbled azerbaijan. in the united states, congressional legislation blocked most assistance to azerbaijan until waiver authority was granted in 2001 in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks and azerbaijan’s subsequent role in assisting u.s. antiterrorism efforts elsewhere., in georgia, nationalism remains centered on the rejection of russia. since the massacre of unarmed civilians by soviet troops in the capital, tbilisi, in 1989 and the post-independence presidency of former soviet dissident—and extreme nationalist—zviad gamsakhurdia, georgian society has generally come to view russia as a usurping occupier. february 25—the day the red army invaded tbilisi in 1921—is still observed annually as soviet occupation day. georgians explain away decades of fawning over the “occupiers” as one ambassador did: “for all those years that the russians ruled us, we told them we loved them. and they actually believed us.” georgian warlords deposed gamsakhurdia in january 1992 and installed former soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze as a weak figurehead. his tenure as president involved a constant renegotiation of his powers to gain ascendancy over those warlords. in the early 1990s, still at his weakest vis-à-vis the warlords and pressured by russian support for abkhaz and ossetian separatism, he tried to harness, not reverse, the extreme nationalism of his predecessor’s supporters, especially those displaced from abkhazia by russian-backed separatists., for their part, russians have acted as emotionally as the georgians, seeing georgia’s aspirations toward the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) and the eu as the betrayal of its once advantageous position within moscow’s empire. during one regularly occurring period of heightened tensions, a normally calm senior russian diplomat asked, “when the soviet union was ruled by people named jughashvili, orjonikidze, and beria, just who was occupying whom?” after the september 11, 2001, attacks, as u.s. troops were arriving in georgia to train georgians in counterterrorism, an embittered russian general, recalling the old times of russian officers’ warm reception in georgia over countless song-and-wine-filled ,  banquets, said, “the americans think they will teach the georgians to fight. in reality, the georgians will teach the americans to sing.”, russia cannot deal with armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia in isolation because the countries’ own relations with one another are dense and fraught with tension and conflict. most salient is the karabakh conflict, over which armenians and azerbaijanis have shed so much blood since 1987. both sides appeal to russia for support and view russian amity toward the other side as a betrayal. in the early years, russia tried to profit from the conflict, clandestinely providing weaponry and mercenaries to both sides. in 1992 and 1993, russians backed two coups to install puppets in azerbaijan, but both backfired. in 1992, former azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov’s attempt to return from moscow was thwarted by the nationalist azerbaijan popular front. and in 1993, surat huseynov’s revolt against the popular front was hijacked by aliyev, who took power for himself alone.,  thereafter, russia stepped back in the region. since brokering a ceasefire in the karabakh conflict in 1994, moscow has limited its interventions to trying (unsuccessfully) to get the sides to agree to a russia-led peacekeeping force of the sort moscow installed to control the abkhazia, south ossetia, and transdniestria separatist conflicts. russia remains a supplier of weaponry to both sides, and every major arms sale to one provokes protests from the other. because azerbaijan’s oil revenues expanded, it has been able to diversify its defense procurements, but armenia remains dependent on russia for arms and security guarantees., georgia is closely intertwined with both armenia and azerbaijan. there are large armenian and azerbaijani minorities in georgia (in separatist abkhazia, armenians actually outnumber the abkhaz). despite initial nationalist difficulties in borchaly, an azerbaijani-inhabited section of georgia, georgian-azerbaijani relations have been good almost since georgia’s independence—largely thanks to a reconciliation of convenience between two soviet-era rivals, eduard shevardnadze and heydar aliyev. aliyev needed georgia to enable the western transit of azerbaijan’s hydrocarbon exports and the import of western goods from turkey. shevardnadze needed azerbaijan to secure oil and gas pipelines to provide both transit royalties and strategic importance to the west.,  he also needed aliyev to help ensure that the large azerbaijani population of georgia reliably voted for shevardnadze’s political grouping, the citizens union., georgian-armenian relations have been trickier. a portion of the armenian population in georgia is concentrated in javakheti, near a large soviet (later russian) military base that fueled the region’s economy until it was closed in 2007. from 1992 to 1993, the javakhk armenians sought independence, apparently with russian encouragement. but armenia’s only transit routes to russia and the west lay through georgia, as the karabakh conflict had closed armenia’s borders with turkey and azerbaijan, so the government of then armenian president levon ter-petrosyan tamped down javakhk separatism. relations between the two countries grew closer after mikheil saakashvili came to the presidency in georgia in 2004, and they have remained friendly under subsequent leaders., to this day, russian policy in the south caucasus is intertwined with the north caucasus—to which russia has devoted the blood and treasure of generations and which post-soviet russia sees as key to the integrity of the russian state. russia’s domestic security concerns have intruded on the south caucasus in a number of areas., as russian power ebbed away at the end of the soviet era, the russian army—for the first time in centuries—no longer wielded the decisive force in the region. the turkish third army was the most powerful military in the region, and locals adapted to the strategic effects. russia threw its diminished resources into the caucasus to suppress the first chechen rebellion—and met defeat. russia’s subsequent remilitarization of the region, and its demands to adapt the conventional armed forces in europe treaty to allow for greater freedom of movement in the flank, stemmed from its perceived need to redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence in the region.,  to address russia’s moves to adapt the treaty, azerbaijan and georgia allied with moldova and ukraine to form what later solidified into the organization for democracy and economic development (known simply as the guam)., ossetians, ethno-linguistically and religiously different from their neighbors, have been russia’s principal allies in the north caucasus for two centuries. as russia dealt with a host of ethnic nationalisms in the first years after the soviet collapse, including chechen separatism and later an armed islamist movement, north ossetia gained strategic importance to, and leverage with, russian leadership. it has used that leverage to ensure robust russian support for south ossetian separatism from georgia., likewise, other ethnic groups in the mountains of the north caucasus (for example, the chechens, kabardians, and cherkes) saw in abkhaz separatism from georgia the validation of their own ethnic nationalisms. with russian facilitation, many so-called volunteers made their way to abkhazia to join the separatist war against georgia from 1992 to 1993. among the most effective of these was the chechen shamil basayev, who was later an archnemesis of the russians but their ally in that struggle., during the second chechen war, fighters and their families took refuge in georgia’s pankisi gorge, which was effectively outside the georgian government’s control. russian president boris yeltsin called shevardnadze in november 1999 to demand the reinstatement of russian border troops in georgia and passage for russian military units through georgia to attack pankisi from the south. shevardnadze stalled and then called on the americans to dissuade yeltsin. later, after the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the united states sent troops to train the georgians to restore security in pankisi, forestalling russian actions there. even worse, from the russian point of view, shevardnadze made a deal with ruslan gelayev, a chechen commander sheltering in the pankisi gorge, to launch an attack on abkhaz-held territory in 2001. the attack failed, but the russian authorities viewed this series of events as proof that georgia was treacherous and untrustworthy., lastly, azerbaijan shares a long border and considerable ethnic overlap with russia’s dagestan autonomous republic, where salafist proselytizing made extensive inroads in the 1990s. after some years, a full-fledged islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked up with the remains of the armed chechen nationalist movement, which also fell under salafist influence. when attacks began on authorities in dagestan, security cooperation with azerbaijan gained importance for russian internal security., the stage was thus set early on for a consistent—even static—russian policy toward the south caucasus: an economy-of-force balancing act to preserve russia’s traditional friendship and strategic alliance with armenia without harming russia’s economic and security relationship with azerbaijan; and a constant, emotional, and ever-deepening hostility toward georgia., russia views the international arena as a series of camps, each centered by a power whose greatness is confirmed by possessing a camp.,  russia has been keen to ensure that the new nations forged out of former soviet republics remain in its camp and has formed multinational institutions to cement those relations., initially, russia had hopes that the commonwealth of independent states (cis), formed when the soviet union broke up, might fill the bill. azerbaijan and armenia joined the cis at its inception in 1991. but it was not until 1993 that georgia’s president shevardnadze—under russian military pressure in support of abkhaz separatism and facing a rebellion by ousted former president gamsakhurdia—reluctantly acceded. in 2008, georgia withdrew from the cis after the country’s defeat in the russo-georgian war. with the cis having little influence, russia put forward two other institutions to accomplish the task., the collective security treaty, originally signed in 1992, became the collective security treaty organization (csto) in 2002, designed as a counterweight to nato. armenia joined to relieve its security concerns with regard to turkey; azerbaijan and georgia did not., the eurasian customs union, officially formed in 2000 but active from 2010 onward, also included armenia but not azerbaijan or georgia. in 2014, russia turned the customs union into the eurasian economic union (eaeu), intended as a mirror image of the eu. moscow’s ongoing attempts to equate the two organizations on the international stage has had significant effects on the caucasus, as noted later in this paper., azerbaijan was able to avoid joining russia’s so-called camp thanks to its independent oil revenues, which have grown for both azerbaijan and other post-soviet caspian littoral states. in the early 1990s, moscow’s ability to project power was low and russia could only protest ineffectually when littoral countries signed hydrocarbon extraction contracts in the absence of an international agreement to define national rights in the caspian.,  azerbaijan, kazakhstan, and turkmenistan brought in western energy majors without fearing russia’s reaction (azerbaijan signed its first major contract in 1993). the status of the caspian was not codified even preliminarily until 2018, and to this day, no treaty covers exploitation of the seabed.,  russia could not fight ’em, so it joined ’em, settling for sharing in the profits from hydrocarbon development and transit., for a time in the mid-1990s, the united states and russia maneuvered against one another through their respective support of pipelines. the united states heavily promoted the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc) pipeline as an alternative to a russian monopoly on hydrocarbon transit to the west. however, u.s. doctrine demanded that the pipeline be commercially viable in its own right, and the united states refused to put resources into boosting that viability. recognizing this, russia banked on the oil majors’ desire to save money by transporting the oil by tanker across the black sea and through the turkish straits. but when then bp chair john browne visited istanbul and inspected the narrow bosphorus passage, he decided the route was too risky and threw the weight of the oil majors behind btc., russia’s closest relationship in the south caucasus remains with armenia, the country most firmly entrenched in russia’s camp. it is frequently called a strategic alliance, and for armenia this is certainly the case as 3,000 russian troops based in its second-largest city, gyumri, form a trip wire against turkish military action., while azerbaijan generally deals with other countries transactionally, another criterion takes precedence: their stance on armenia and the karabakh conflict. this is the trickiest situation for russia to manage: azerbaijan is russia’s largest trading partner in the caucasus, the two countries have important common issues regarding hydrocarbons, and russia sees a strategic aim in keeping azerbaijan out of what it calls the western camp. therefore, while supporting armenia, russia has tried to avoid alienating azerbaijan, including during the recent surge in fighting. until 2010, russia was discreet about its arms sales to armenia to avoid provoking azerbaijan, denying reports of large arms transfers when they surfaced in 2009.,  more recently, russia has started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry to both sides and has been more open about its balancing. for example, in 2010, russia signed a new lease on its military base in gyumri (extending it to 2044) and agreed to sell s-300 surface-to-air missiles to azerbaijan., as part of this balancing, russia is involved in attempts to mediate between azerbaijan and armenia to resolve the karabakh conflict. since 1995, russia has been a co-chair of the minsk group, a body under the aegis of the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce) and composed of a number of countries interested in brokering peace. in 1997, the united states and france joined russia as co-chairs, and the three countries have conducted all negotiations thereafter without significant input from the other group members. this structure has facilitated russia-west cooperation to keep a politically insoluble problem from flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline states. when dmitry medvedev was president of russia (2008–2012), he poured great efforts into russian peace initiatives, and with french and u.s. assent russia came to dominate the process. as part of this campaign, medvedev also supported the 2008 opening between armenia and turkey, azerbaijan’s closest ally. that rapprochement failed, however, due to opposition from key constituencies on both sides. ultimately, azerbaijan and armenia were not interested in a negotiated solution, and medvedev’s initiative foundered., russia’s relations with georgia quickly went into a downward spiral after the soviet collapse. russia used substantial military force to ensure the survival and then victory of the separatist rebellion in abkhazia and leveraged that and a revolt by gamsakhurdia to force shevardnadze to accept a russian peacekeeping force in western georgia. still hostile, russia backed two attempts, in 1995 and 1998, to assassinate shevardnadze. until the latter attempt, shevardnadze had been trying to play russia and the united states off against each other, but these actions drove shevardnadze squarely into the arms of the united states., the russians loathed shevardnadze for his role in the collapse of the soviet bloc—on one television program, he was reviled as “the ostap bender of the soviet union,” after the con-man protagonist of the classic soviet comic novel , . but that feeling paled beside the emotions stoked in the russian leadership by the flamboyant and mercurial mikheil saakashvili, who ousted shevardnadze at the end of 2003 and became president in 2004. in that year, saakashvili also ousted the quasi-independent aslan abashidze from his rule over the autonomous batumi region, which housed a russian military base. also in 2004, tensions flared in south ossetia. russia retaliated over the next few years, banning the import of georgian products, banning flights between russia and georgia, closing the land border between the two countries, and launching an aggressive campaign against ethnic georgians in russia, including russian citizens, their businesses, and their families. in 2007, russia closed off most of north ossetia to foreigners, allowing preparations for war to proceed unseen by the outside world. and in 2008, as tensions flared again in south ossetia, russian troops invaded, defeating georgia’s forces in short order, occupying parts of georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia, and incorporating these conquests into the separatist statelets, which russia shortly thererafter recognized as independent.,  but the war also brought the expansion of a new competitor’s presence: the small, neutral osce mission was scrapped, and a large new eu monitoring mission was put in its place.,  despite the limitations placed on that mission, the overall eu presence and commitment sharply increased., putin’s return to the presidency in 2012 came with a more assertive foreign policy. new leaders wholly dependent on russia were installed in the separatist entities russia supported, including south ossetia and abkhazia, replacing long-established leaders who were pro-russian but possessed their own independent power bases. more importantly, russia began to treat the european union—not just nato—as a strategic rival intent on taking over parts of what medvedev had called russia’s sphere of “, .” five years earlier, that view had been restricted to the , , or senior officers of the hard power ministries (primarily the military, internal affairs, and security services); after putin’s return to the presidency, it became russia’s official policy., the ukrainian crisis of 2013–2014 began with putin pressuring both ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and armenian president serzh sargsyan into repudiating the eu association agreements they had signed and instead joining the nascent russia-centric eaeu. the pressure on sargsyan included a putin visit to azerbaijan’s capital, baku, to discuss arms sales. yanukovych’s caving to putin’s pressure triggered the revolution of dignity in ukraine and his eventual downfall. sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequences. he explained to the nation that security concerns necessitated joining the russian-led organization—that only russia could safeguard armenia from its neighbors. however, after rejecting the eu, sargsyan immediately tried to placate it. negotiations eventually restarted on a trade agreement, and in 2017, armenia signed a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with the eu., after a few protests, armenians fell in line with sargsyan’s capitulation to putin’s wishes: they assumed their security expectations would be met and that this change was worth the economic disadvantages of giving up the association with the eu. indeed, when a few months later russia occupied crimea and annexed it after the fig leaf of a controlled referendum, armenians saw this as a model and justification for future annexation of nagornyy karabakh and the surrounding territories. russia’s actions had called into question all territorial dispositions after the soviet collapse, which had been agreed among the union republics, codified in the cis treaty, and endorsed by the international community. with borders now questioned and russia more capable of projecting power, it was better to be a close ally of russia than a potential victim., but in april 2016, armenians suffered a rude awakening. on april 1, azerbaijan began a military operation along the line of contact in karabakh and, over the next four days, managed to regain a few strategic points occupied by the karabakh armenians years before. russia’s reaction was to maintain its balancing act. russian foreign minister sergey lavrov went to the region explicitly to be a neutral mediator. he brought a ceasefire plan and proposed the russian peacekeeping force that had been rejected so many years earlier. that approach did not go over well with the armenian populace. in their view, armenia was a treaty ally of russia and had given up european aspirations to stay in russia’s camp—and, therefore, russia should be on armenia’s side. however, as far as russia was concerned, legally, the combat had nothing to do with armenia but was between nagornyy karabakh and azerbaijan. the armenian people did not see it that way, after being convinced by their leaders over a generation that karabakh and armenia had become a single polity. sargsyan, who initially supported the idea of a russian peacekeeping force, was seen as having sold out armenian interests. he then had to backtrack, putting fatal cracks in his prestige and authority., almost immediately, mutinies and demonstrations broke out, occasionally with a subtle anti-russian flavor. in july 2016, a group of gunmen calling themselves sasna tsrer (“daredevils of sassoun,” from an armenian epic poem) violently took over a police station and held out against government forces for two weeks, demanding sargsyan’s resignation. even after they surrendered, they retained widespread support, which translated into a people fed up with the ruling elite and with russia.,  other factors—such as a notorious murder by a russian soldier, price hikes by the russian-owned electricity supplier, and continued arms sales to azerbaijan—further exacerbated popular discontent., in 2017, faced with term limits when his presidency was to expire in 2018, sargsyan chose one of the standard post-soviet autocratic solutions to staying in power: establishing a parliamentary system, turning the presidency into a figurehead, and becoming prime minister. sargsyan and his dashnak nationalist allies duly won parliamentary elections in 2017, and a figurehead president was in due course elected in 2018. then the play went off script: the aggrieved populace rose up in demonstrations, and in just over a month, sargsyan was ousted. opposition leader nikol pashinyan was installed as acting prime minister, and new elections affirmed his position later in the year., so far, this scenario resembles one of the “color revolutions” that putin had railed against for the previous fifteen years and had tried to reverse through military force in georgia, syria, and ukraine. but instead of condemning pashinyan (who had sharply criticized russia during the demonstrations) and lending full support to sargsyan (one of putin’s most loyal supporters), putin was remarkably restrained throughout and had a friendly and supportive meeting with pashinyan just days after the latter took power, publicly offering him his congratulations and best wishes., it is possible that russia blamed sargsyan for the anti-russian sentiment following the clashes of april 2016.,  but it is also clear that pashinyan made efforts to reassure putin, as he—like the entire armenian electorate—understood that russia remained the guarantor of armenia’s security vis-à-vis its much larger neighbors. he also understood that any rift with russia would create a vulnerability that azerbaijan could exploit with regard to karabakh; pashinyan knew he could not afford any daylight between armenia and russia. he left armenia in the eaeu and csto. he made clear that he would pursue a democratic system, but he “also said that he viewed democracy as a firm belief, rather than a geopolitical orientation, making clear the distinction.”,  perhaps the fact that putin knew this as well, implying no major changes in armenia’s strategic orientation, occasioned his restraint: if there is no threat that armenia will leave its camp, russia can continue balancing its policy toward azerbaijan and armenia., azerbaijan is the type of country with which putin seems to feel comfortable—a stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policies. azerbaijan causes few headaches for russia and demands only that its transactional approach be reciprocated. president ilham aliyev began his rule only three years after putin took over russia; his father heydar aliyev had ruled azerbaijan for a decade before that, not counting the soviet period, when he also ruled the country as his own fiefdom. heydar aliyev’s time in the senior-most ranks of the soviet state, communist party, and security services ,  made his attitude very different from other post-soviet rulers, some of whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki in soviet times and saw moscow as the source of all power. heydar aliyev treated russia’s post-soviet rulers without the fealty or fear that some of his contemporaries showed., ilham aliyev does not have the experience or ability of his father, but he has inherited that legacy of autonomous sovereignty. if pashinyan intends to show that democracy is a belief, not a geopolitical choice, the aliyevs have long since shown that the same is true of autocracy. azerbaijan and russia have enjoyed a functional, transactional relationship that is cordial, neighborly, and devoid of emotion. to some extent, azerbaijan grew ideologically closer to russia in the wake of the ukraine crisis, as both countries saw themselves as attacked and undermined by a fifth column of western-supported civil society and nongovernmental organizations. in 2014, the chief of azerbaijan’s presidential apparatus—usually considered closest to russia in the azerbaijani leadership—published a long, scathing article outlining that worldview. he even implied that charges of human rights violations against a country only proved that its leadership was defending its sovereignty., but ideological sympathy never overcame azerbaijan’s transactional approach to relations with russia. in 2012, azerbaijan demanded a sharp increase in the rent russia was paying for the soviet-era qabala radar station. the station was part of the soviet and russian strategic early warning system, and therefore the united states favored its continued functioning to help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launches. nonetheless, azerbaijan stuck to its price demands, and the russians eventually closed the station at the end of 2012., apart from its transactional approach, the azerbaijani leadership has a single prism for judging the actions of all other countries: the karabakh conflict. since independence, azerbaijan has rejected virtually all forms of multilateral cooperation involving armenia. that has imposed a durable limit on the extent of rapprochement with russia. for example, azerbaijan has not joined the csto, of which armenia is a member; to do so, it would have to renounce any military solution to the karabakh conflict, and it has been a tenet of faith in azerbaijan that only the credible threat of a military solution can pressure armenia to negotiate seriously. nor has azerbaijan joined the eaeu, as armenia did. joining it could limit azerbaijan’s ability to use its economic leverage to marshal international support on karabakh and counter armenian diaspora influence in the west, particularly in the united states and france., indeed, because russia’s annexation of crimea calls into question the borders of the former soviet republics—which the republics recognize as state borders under the alma-ata declaration of december 21, 1991—it also calls into question the basis for azerbaijani claims to sovereignty over nagornyy karabakh. moreover, for the last fifteen years, proposed principles for a negotiated peace in the karabakh conflict have included a “binding expression of the popular will” as part of the ultimate disposition of the territory.,  the russia-staged referendum in crimea drove home to the azerbaijanis how easy it is for the power with boots on the ground to ensure its desired outcome in such a vote., all in all, since 2014, azerbaijan has become, if anything, even more transactional in its approach to russia. the 2016 offensive in karabakh, which might earlier have been deterred by reluctance to antagonize russia, can be seen as one example. the fighting azerbaijan initiated on september 27, 2020, can also be seen as a transaction with russia—one made possible by turkish intervention. to be sure, one aim of the offensive is to regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chips from armenia’s side of the board. but perhaps the larger aim is to threaten putin with instability and possibly a region-wide war if he does not force deep concessions on armenia. aliyev ignored lavrov’s initial offer: the return of two provinces, in exchange for russia being allowed to deploy a peacekeeping force.,  whatever the outcome, it is clear that to azerbaijan, russia is now less of a partner and more of a problem to be solved., azerbaijan tries to solve its russia problem through closer relations with, in particular, turkey and china. turkey has long been azerbaijan’s main advocate in the international sphere. aside from ethnic kinship (a significant azeri population lives in eastern turkey) and deep historical links before the soviet takeover, turkey is quick to cite certain protectorate rights granted under the treaties of moscow and kars (1921). since independence, azerbaijan has seen turkey as a counterweight to russian power. at present, however, turkey has its own complex relations with russia. turkey enjoys the positive effects of continued close energy and pipeline relations, as well as personal interactions between putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan; but offsetting these effects are sharp differences between turkey and russia on the conflicts in syria and libya. azerbaijan seeks to ensure that turkey’s support vis-à-vis russia is unwavering. turkey’s support of azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement in the autumn 2020 fighting have granted azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver vis-à-vis russia—both on the battlefield and with regard to russian mediation efforts. it took the kremlin almost two weeks to arrange a putin-aliyev phone call; a humanitarian truce brokered by lavrov fell apart almost immediately., china has increased its engagement with the caucasus as part of its belt and road initiative, though neither its trade nor investment in the region compare with its far more massive engagement in central asia.,  its main partner in the region is azerbaijan, which has the largest population, economy, and reserves of natural resources. the partnership makes sense geopolitically as well: although china is now a major trading partner for armenia and georgia, armenia is too dependent on russia to be pried loose and china is probably wary of russian sensitivities on georgia. china has now become the third largest source of imports for azerbaijan, after russia and turkey. azerbaijan presents the most potential for future political rapprochement, and china, unlike the west, is not burdened with concerns over azerbaijan’s human rights record. azerbaijan hopes that as the belt and road initiative progresses, china will increase its use of azerbaijan for the transit of cargo to europe—floating cargo across the caspian and loading it onto the railroad link opened in 2017 between baku and kars, in turkey, via georgia., putin once famously declared that he would hang saakashvili by his testicles.,  that promise remains unfulfilled, but not for want of trying. saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority in 2012 and was voted out of office in 2013. if putin thought saakashvili’s ouster by the billionaire (and, until shortly before then, russian citizen) bidzina ivanishvili and his georgian dream party would liberate a wellspring of affection for russia, he was in for disappointment. the georgian populace remains deeply suspicious of russia. in late 2014, nato initiated a major assistance program, the substantial nato-georgia package, sharply ramping up security cooperation with the georgian dream government., russia’s hostile and aggressive policy toward georgia, too, remains unchanged. as always, the pressure point between russia and georgia has been separatism, namely the russia-backed polities in abkhazia and south ossetia. in the run-up to putin’s return to the presidency, long-serving local officials in many areas controlled by russia, especially in the russia-supported south ossetia and abkhazia (and transdniestria, outside the region), were ousted, with moscow backing newcomers who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience to putin alone. at the end of 2011, edmund kokoity, who had ruled south ossetia since 2001, was forced to resign from the leadership and was ultimately replaced by leonid tibilov, a veteran of the kgb.,  in abkhazia, the death of sergei bagapsh in may 2011 triggered a premature power struggle that threw the plans off track; in the elections that followed, moscow’s chosen candidate, raul khajimba, was defeated. however, with the intervention of putin’s fixer vladislav surkov, president alexander ankvab was ousted in june 2014 and khajimba was installed., by then, russia had occupied and annexed crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprisings in donbass, as well as kharkiv and odessa; in response, the west had imposed sanctions. perhaps this left putin and his regime less concerned with placating western opinion, and he moved to annex the separatists in all but name. as early as october 13, 2014—the month after khajimba’s inauguration—russia presented abkhazia with a draft treaty of alliance, integration and partnership, whose main points were the takeover of key executive departments of the abkhaz “state” by their russian homologues, with, at best, nominal abkhazian security institutions serving as a fig leaf. russia presented south ossetia with a draft comprising identical terms at about the same time, though the first public announcement came in november. in the treaties that were eventually signed, the abkhaz won face-saving concessions from the russians;,  it took four drafts before the south ossetians signed, but their version was closer to the russian original.,  (the close informal relations between south ossetia and north ossetia made the words on paper less important.) the stifling embrace of moscow—and the suspected poisoning of khajimba’s electoral rival, —led to the ouster of khajimba in early 2020 and his replacement by aslan bzhania, himself a veteran of the kgb.,  in south ossetia, anatoliy bibilov, who had floated between the north and south ossetian militaries, defeated tibilov., russian actions have continued to ensure that georgian resentment over the ,  remains an open wound. the process of borderization continues in south ossetia: russian border troops periodically erect new border fences that enclose bits of land hitherto under georgian control. in july 2015, new border fences cut off part of the strategic baku-supsa oil pipeline, the line that carried azerbaijani “early oil” to market in the west before the main baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline was completed. russia has not interfered with the oil flow, but the implied threat is clear., for its part, it appears that georgia under saakashvili tried to return this threat by reopening links with chechen and islamist rebel groups in the north caucasus, as shevardnadze had done with the chechen commander gelayev in 2001. russia charged in 2009—and again in 2012 after a murky incident in the lopota gorge (between the pankisi gorge and dagestan)—that georgia was arming and training chechen militants to fight inside russia. in 2017, several years after saakashvili was replaced by the less anti-russian georgian dream party, the chechen commander involved in the lopota incident was killed by georgian security forces in tbilisi., thus, a cycle of perceived provocations followed by emotional reactions and retaliations continues today. most recently, a russian’s mere choice of seating at a meeting led to crisis between the two countries. from june 19 to 23, 2019, the interparliamentary assembly on orthodoxy met in the parliament in tbilisi with orthodox parliamentarians from many countries in attendance. this was presumably intended as a gesture at reconciliation between the orthodox majorities of russia and georgia. on june 20, a member of the russian state duma presided over the session and sat in the georgian parliament chair’s seat. violent street protests immediately broke out in tbilisi, disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation of georgia’s parliament chair the following day.,  amid continuing protests against russia in tbilisi, putin ordered the cessation of direct flights between georgia and russia—as he had in the run-up to the 2008 war.,  the incident highlights that symbols of power relations evoke both charged emotions and material retaliations and that the pattern of events will be repeated for the foreseeable future., it is hard not to conclude that putin’s personal overreach in ukraine has led to suboptimal results for russia in the south caucasus. when he resumed the presidency of russia, putin increased engagement with the south caucasus, perhaps hoping to gather some castaway stones closer into the russian camp. by autumn, 2013, everything seemed to be going his way: armenia (and ukraine) had bowed to his demands to reject association agreements with the eu and to sign on instead with the eaeu that putin had singlehandedly created, promoted, and dominated. relations with azerbaijan were on an even keel without much expenditure of effort. and georgia’s despised saakashvili had been replaced by a russian billionaire whose government was floating trial balloons about normalizing relations with moscow despite russia’s recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia., but relations with all three south caucasus countries reverted to type after russia’s intervention in ukraine. moscow’s stifling embrace of rulers such as sargsyan and khajimba led to popular discontent and their forcible ousters. the precedents set on ukrainian territory led azerbaijan to proceed with extreme caution in its relations with russia. and russia’s expansionist policies with regard to abkhazia and south ossetia have guaranteed the hostility of the georgian populace and repudiation by what might have been a friendlier government. as observers have noted, major outside powers such as china, turkey, and the eu have capitalized on local suspicions of russia. they have developed strong interests in all three south caucasus countries and have the wherewithal to defend those interests against russian maneuvering, while also providing the locals with greater room for maneuver. turkey’s willingness to take a major military role in support of azerbaijan in the fighting that began september 27 shows that russian power no longer has the deterrent effect it once did against intervention by outside powers. russian interests themselves are not yet seriously threatened, but expansion of those interests has been blunted. one can say, then, that russia’s policies in the south caucasus and in the wider post-soviet space have forced it back on the stony path it had been treading for a generation and will probably tread for some time to come., philip remler is a nonresident scholar at the carnegie endowment for international peace. prior to joining carnegie, he served at the u.s. department of state and the

readers., moscow—in russia, the u.s. presidential election has become a national obsession. ordinary people who rely on state-controlled television as their main source of information have seen the topic pop up every day on multiple talk shows. among the elite, the duel between u.s. president donald trump and former vice president joe biden has become the favorite topic of conversation at fancy restaurants and in the corridors of power., the prevailing view is that a victory for biden would be bad for russia, because a democratic administration is expected to impose new economic sanctions on moscow as punishment for its bad behavior—first and foremost, for its interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election. this view is widely shared by pro-kremlin pundits, senior officials and the executives of state-owned enterprises, and is even promoted by the few remaining independent russian media outlets such as the ,  newsletter, a daily staple in the information diet of the russian upper-middle class., a more nuanced view on biden is held by some people working on u.s. issues in the russian government. a president who is not tainted by suspicion of being a russian asset—and who knows how to organize a normal process for national security discussions—will be able to restore some guardrails to the u.s.-russia relationship and prevent further deterioration, those people argue. a president biden would not be able to pay close attention to russia, since he and his senior advisers will be overwhelmed by domestic issues and otherwise focusing on china. but a possible new democratic administration appears to be open to retaining some pillars of the arms control regime and discussing rules of competition in cyberspace. and it could be more clear-eyed—and therefore skeptical—about the side effects and efficiency of sanctions as the united states’ major tool in russia policy. much will depend on who is put in senior positions such as secretary of state and national security advisor, and on the midlevel bureaucrats controlling the russia portfolio., after u.s.-russian relations nearly hit rock bottom on trump’s watch, nobody in russia believes that four more years of trump could be good for moscow. if trump is reelected, the only silver lining will be the even deeper level of disarray in the western alliance and u.s. disengagement from its partners that a second trump term would likely bring. for the kremlin, schadenfreude over the gradual demise of pax americana would simply sugarcoat the risks and downsides of trump remaining in the white house.,  is a senior fellow at the carnegie moscow center.\\\\xa0twitter:\\\\xa0, trending now , more from foreign policy][\"despite some tough sanctions and even tougher criticism, russia has not topped americas foreign policy priorities under president donald trump, who has appeared to have a congenial relationship with his counterpart vladimir putin.\", however, that could all change if democrat nominee joe biden wins the november 3 election, according to experts, who are weighing up the implications of a biden presidency on u.s.-russia relations., at the very least, analysts expect that a victory for biden would increase tensions between washington and moscow, and would raise the probability of new sanctions on russia., the country is already operating under international sanctions on some key sectors and russian officials close to putin, for actions including its annexation of crimea from ukraine in 2014, interference in the u.s. election in 2016 and reported involvement in a nerve agent attack in the u.k. in 2018., andrius tursa, central and eastern europe advisor at teneo intelligence, said a win for biden would improve transatlantic ties between the u.s. and europe and would see \"a renewed u.s. commitment to nato\" that would be welcomed by europe., however he also said such a result would mean \"mostly downsides for russia,\" citing a recent history of mutual distrust and acrimonious relations between the kremlin and u.s. democrats., \"in general, a potential biden presidency would be negative for moscow and likely lead to a further deterioration of bilateral relations, both in terms of rhetoric and substance. the democratic party\\\\s candidate has long maintained a tough stance towards president vladimir putin\\\\s administration,\" tursa said in a note friday., \"the kremlin\\\\s disdain for biden, meanwhile, dates back to his vice-presidency, particularly his push for sanctions against russia in response to the 2014 ukrainian crisis.\", a meaningful conflict resolution over crimea, and in the donbass region in east ukraine (where there are two pro-russian regions that declared themselves republics) still eludes moscow and kiev, despite efforts by germany and france to broker a lasting settlement that both sides can live with., tursa argued that without tangible process in ,  – a region biden was heavily involved in as vice president – \"moscow could hardly expect any meaningful easing of sanctions,\" and that a potential biden presidency could lead to more stringent enforcement of existing measures., the risk of new sanctions could also increase, he said, , any new sanctions on russia are unlikely to be imposed immediately, however, according to timothy ash, senior emerging markets strategist at bluebay asset management., he said on saturday that \"while i do think the course of u.s.-russia relations will remain on this deteriorating path i am not sure\\\\xa0that we should expect an immediate rollout of additional \\\\pent up\\\\ sanctions on russia.\", \"i think those candidates likely to be running russian affairs in a biden presidency are all pretty experienced and level headed. they won\\\\t want to roll out sanctions for sanctions sake. they will want to be very proportionate and logical in approach,\" he said, emphasizing that it\\\\s \"important for the u.s. to have a business-like relationship with russia to ensure delivery on the u.s.\\\\s strategic interests.\", he said the two sides, under a biden presidency, would have to \"learn where they can tolerate each other and get along on certain areas of mutual interest — such as arms control — and reducing risks of conflict where strategic interests compete, for example on areas like ukraine, even belarus and turkey. sanctions will be part of the tool kit herein, but only one such tool.\",  is an area that both russia-watchers believe could be a point of mutual interest and some harmony, however. biden has signaled as much, saying in 2019 that he would want to see an extension of the major u.s.-russian nuclear arms reduction treaty, known as the new strategic arms reduction treaty, or the implementation something similar., \"based on recent statements from both sides, negotiations on a new strategic arms reduction treaty (start) is one area where progress could be expected if biden is elected,\" teneo\\\\s tursa said. \"however, the timeline would be extremely challenging as the current treaty expires on 5 february 2021.\", russia itself has acknowledged that arms control could be one positive dynamic under a biden presidency. earlier in october, putin criticized what he called \"sharp anti-russian rhetoric\" from biden, but also said that he had been encouraged by biden\\\\s comments regarding a new arms treaty or extension of new start., got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you., sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your

and asia to learn more about how adversaries could threaten the election this year., by,  , fort meade, md. — the united states cyber command expanded its overseas operations aimed at finding foreign hacking groups before the election on tuesday, an effort to identify not only russian tactics but also those of china and iran, military officials said., in addition to new operations in europe to pursue russian hackers, cyber command sent teams to the middle east and asia over the past two years to help find iranian, chinese and north korean hacking teams and identify the tools they were using to break into computer networks., cyber command was expanding on a push begun in 2018, when it ,  to north macedonia, montenegro and other countries to learn more about russian operations. the move also reflects a stepped-up effort to secure this year’s presidential election., cyber command, which runs the military’s offensive and defensive operations in the online world, was largely on the sidelines in 2016. but for the 2018 midterm elections, the command took a far more aggressive posture. in addition to sending the teams to allied countries, it ,  to would-be russian trolls before the vote, in its first offensive operation against moscow; it then ,  on election day and the days afterward., the 2018 operation was focused mostly on russia, according to what is publicly known about it. but before the election this year, intelligence officials have described efforts by iran and china, as well as russia, to potentially influence the vote, and cyber command has also widened its focus., “since 2018, we have expanded our hunt forward operations to all major adversaries,” lt. gen. charles l. moore jr., the deputy head of cyber command, said in an interview in his office at fort meade., cyber command calls its work with allies to find enemy hackers “hunt forward operations.” after getting close to foreign adversaries’ own networks, cyber command can then get inside to identify and potentially neutralize attacks on the united states, according to current and former officials., “we want to find the bad guys in red space, in their own operating environment,” general moore said. “we want to take down the archer rather than dodge the arrows.”, officials would identify only regions and not the countries they had operated in before the 2020 election. but cyber command officials said those efforts uncovered malware being used by adversarial hacking teams. other government agencies used that information to help state and local officials shore up their election system defenses and to notify the public about threats., cyber command sends teams of experts overseas to work with partner and allied nations to help them find, identify and remove hostile intrusions on their government or military computer networks., for the allied nations, inviting cyber command operatives not only helps improve their network defenses but also demonstrates to adversaries that the united states military is working with them. for the united states, the deployments give their experts an early look at tactics that potential adversaries are honing in their own neighborhoods, techniques that could later be used against americans., the information gathered in the hunt forward operations was shared with the rest of the u.s. government to help defend critical networks before the election, gen. paul m. nakasone, the head of cyber command, wrote in an ,  in august., cybersecurity experts have argued that the deployments allow cyber command to work alongside partner teams that are under daily attack by russia, iran or china., “the best way to get intelligence is through true cooperation and collaboration with other teams combating it,” said theresa payton, a cybersecurity expert and a former official under the george w. bush administration. “they will have received different types of targeted attacks you may not have seen.”, cyber command officials said they continued to try to identify and stop foreign threats to the election after the midterm vote in 2018, adding new partners to their defensive network., “the attacks are always ongoing; that is why cyber command’s ongoing work with other countries’ military cyberoperations is our best way to be on offense to protect american interests,” said ms. payton, whose book “manipulated” examined emerging types of cyberattacks., some lawmakers and experts believe that foreign influence efforts could increase should there be a disputed election result, amplifying claims of fraud or demands for recounts., similarly, cyber command officials said their efforts to try to counter foreign threats would not end with the close of voting on tuesday; they will continue as votes are counted and the electoral college prepares to meet in december., “we are not stopping or thinking about our operations slacking off on nov. 3,” general moore said. “defending the election is now a persistent and ongoing campaign for cyber command.”, advertisement][disabling auto-updates may improve reliability when using a screen reader or keyboard to navigate., advertisement, supported

tech giants including facebook, twitter and google have been sending out statements every few days advertising how many foreign influence operations they have blocked, all while banning forms of disinformation in ways they never imagined even a year ago., it is all intended to send a clear message that whatever russia is up to in the last weeks before election day, it is no hoax. the goal, both federal officials and corporate executives say, is to disrupt russia’s well-honed information-warfare systems, whether they are poised to hack election systems, amplify america’s political fissures or get inside the minds of voters., but behind the scenes is a careful dance by members of the trump administration to counter the president’s own disinformation campaign, one that says the outcome on nov. 3 will be “rigged” unless he wins., so while president trump continues to dismiss the idea of russian intervention, a combination of administration and industry officials are pushing a different narrative: that u.s. intelligence agencies, facebook, twitter, google and others are avoiding the mistakes of four years ago, when they all had their radars off., but there is also no assurance it will work., “we don’t like to admit it, but the russians may not be deterrable,” said james a. lewis, the director of the technology and public policy program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington. “how far do we have to go? is this far enough? we are still scoping that out.”, no one will be able to assess the effectiveness of the counteroffensive until after election day, when washington circulates the cyberequivalent of battle-damage reports. but even now there are reasons to question whether the efforts to take on russia, some of which began in the 2018 midterm elections, have been too timid., it is hardly a coincidence that the indictments announced on monday against hackers with russia’s g.r.u. were unsealed 15 days before the election. but it is unclear what deterrent effect indictments can have when the g.r.u.’s officers are unlikely to ever see the inside of an american courtroom., one of the hackers named in the indictment was previously charged with hacking u.s. election administrators four years ago. that did not stop him from a brazen hacking on the country of georgia last year. likewise, even after russia was outed for hacking the 2018 pyeongchang olympics, that apparently did nothing to dissuade it from , , british officials revealed monday., john p. carlin, the former assistant attorney general for national security who developed much of the justice department’s strategy for indicting foreign hackers, and later wrote about it in the book “dawn of the code war,” said mr. trump’s denial of what happened four years ago gave russia lots of leeway., “the details in the indictment are stunning and reveal russian operatives at the direction of the state attacking the whole world,” he said, adding that “the conspicuous absence of leadership from president trump” on the issue was all the more striking given the efforts “to expose and disrupt this activity.”, “these attacks on countries and civilian behavior won’t stop until the commander-in-chief calls it out and works with the rest of the victimized world to deter future indiscriminate attacks,” mr. carlin said., if the indictments are the public face of the offensive against the russians, the effort to dismantle trickbot — a vast network of infected computers used by ransomware groups — is the more covert element., late last month, the military’s cyber command started neutralizing trickbot with a series of attacks. microsoft’s digital crimes unit secured federal court orders to shut down trickbot’s infrastructure around the world., on tuesday, microsoft said the operation had been largely successful. it has taken down over 90 percent of trickbot’s command-and-control servers. the idea is to keep the russians on the run, so distracted that they are unable to use those systems for ransomware attacks that could hold the election hostage., “these guys are really good and really move fast, and we knew they would react to rebuild their systems,” said tom burt, the microsoft executive who is running the team. “we were prepared to follow them, and tear down whatever they build up.”, but as cyber command and microsoft were taking aim at trickbot, a new hacking threat emerged., over the past two months, a different group of russian hackers — known as “energetic bear” or “dragonfly,” and believed to be operating within the country’s federal security service, or f.s.b., the successor to the soviet-era k.g.b. — has been targeting american state and local networks, according to government and private security researchers., their goal is still unclear, but the timing — so close to the election — and the actor, which was , have sent alarm bells ringing at cyber command and at security firms like fireeye. cyberscoop ,  of a leaked fireeye report on the campaign on monday., officials worry that even if those hackings do not amount to much, the russians’ very presence inside u.s. state and local systems could be used to support the president’s baseless allegations that the election is “rigged.”, that was part of the motivation behind an unusual nine-minute video posted online this month — titled “safeguarding your vote”— featuring senior american law enforcement, intelligence and cybersecurity officials., “we are not going to tolerate foreign interference in our elections or criminal activity that threatens the sanctity of your vote or undermines public confidence in the outcome of the election,” christopher a. wray, the f.b.i. director, assured voters., mr. wray and his counterparts have been contradicted at every turn by the president, who continues to assail mail-in voting as an avenue for fraud, for which there is no evidence. mr. trump’s claims are often amplified by the russians, whose main interest is to cast doubt about the credibility of free elections., “trump has been a godsend to russia,” mr. lewis said., in silicon valley, executives believe a “perception hack” may pose the greatest threat to the election and have been mounting their own counternarrative., facebook, twitter and google have all talked up coordination with one another and the government. the companies were credited, with cisco’s talos cybersecurity unit, as having played a role in the indictments of the six g.r.u. officers announced on monday., twitter has talked up its takedown of state-backed influence campaigns from russia, saudi arabia, thailand, cuba and iran, and has slapped more overt warning messages on tweets that violate its policies, including those from the president., facebook has advertised its takedowns of foreign influence campaigns from china and the philippines and 300 russian assets. it has also lowered its tolerance for disinformation., after years of allowing holocaust deniers a place on its platform, facebook started censoring that content this month and stepping up its crackdown of qanon, which promotes a conspiracy that the world is run by satan-worshiping pedophiles plotting against mr. trump., the question is whether these efforts, so late in the election cycle, will have the intended effect, since the president has already primed his supporters, and others, to distrust the “fake news,” the “deep state” and now, the election., advertisement][updated 2002 gmt (0402 hkt) october 26, 2020 , last month, both twitter and facebook

of dissuading them from supporting the biden-harris ticket., \"sign up for cnn opinions new \", join us on , and ][both countries are cooperating more than ever, but would moscow really help beijing in that way?, russia has the knowledge, but china has the money. would moscow help beijing for the right price?, it appears that china is relying on russian know-how and experience to develop the reactor for its first nuclear aircraft carrier. as the,  reports, china appears to be studying the nuclear reactors on russia’s largest icebreakers, an approach that the soviet union also took when it planned to build nuclear carriers in the 1980s. specifically, russia has invited china to bid on the construction of a new class of nuclear icebreaker, necessarily requiring the development of surface-ship based reactors. this approach stands in contrast to how the united states and france developed nuclear reactors for their largest carriers, but probably represents the best choice for china at this point.\\\\xa0, \\\\n, to appreciate what’s at stake in china’s pursuit of nuclear-powered surface warships, it’s important to review the experience of the united states and the ussr. after the successful development of the uss ,  and the ,  class nuclear attack submarines (as well as the merchant ship ns , ) provided proof-of-concept regarding nuclear propulsion, the usn began to evaluate nuclear power for surface warships. the first usn nuclear surface warship was the cruiser uss , , commissioned in 1961. ,  was powered by 2 c1ws reactors, generating around 120 mw, enough power to produce a speed of 30 knots for the 17,000-ton cruiser hull. the usn rapidly followed up with uss enterprise, powered by 8 a2w reactors, each quite similar in construction and output to the c1w. those reactors generated 120 mw each, translating to 280,000 shp, driving the 100,000-ton ,  at up to 33 knots., a few other nuclear cruisers and destroyers followed, but the advantages of nuclear power in surface warfare ships was limited by cost. aircraft carriers were a different story. the , class, which began to enter service in 1975, use two a4w reactors, each rated at 550 mw. the recently commissioned uss ,  carries two a1b reactors, capable of generating 700 mw. the extra power generation capacity of the ,  has little to do with speed. rather, the power provides a surplus usable for a variety of different systems, including emals and highly sophisticated sensors. down the road, the extra energy may power point-defense lasers and similar equipment. overall, the reactors open up space to modernize and modify the , \\\\xa0vessels, keeping them effective for their decades of project life.\\\\n, the soviet experience was somewhat different. while the soviets enjoyed considerable success in developing nuclear reactors for submarines, they approached the question of surface warships much more carefully. the first nuclear powered soviet ship was the icebreaker , , commissioned in 1959 with three ok-150 reactors (90 mw each). between 1975 and 1990, the soviets would commission nine more nuclear icebreakers of the ,  and ,  classes, generally displacing between 20,000 and 25,000 tons and carrying two ok-900 reactors, capable of 150 mw.\\\\xa0\\\\n, these ships provided valuable experience, but the soviets were slow to make the leap to nuclear-powered surface combatants, in part because soviet warships were expected to operate closer to home than their u.s. counterparts. in 1974, however, the soviets began building the first of four ships of the ,  class, 26,000-ton battlecruisers with both nuclear and conventional propulsion. reports differ on the power capacity of the two kn-3 reactors, with a range from 150 mw to 300 mw. these reactors would also have powered the ,  class supercarriers, a class of ships that was canceled upon the collapse of the ussr.\\\\xa0, \\\\n, the chinese are undoubtedly thinking along lines similar to those of the late soviets., 003 will be a conventional catobar carrier) suggest a ship roughly the size and sophistication of the , , which of course would require immense power-generation capabilities. like the united states, china wants excess power generation in order to field a suite of future weapons and sensors. for this purpose, china needs reactors more powerful than those that it currently uses on its submarines, and building icebreakers for russia may provide the necessary experience., this approach stands in contrast to that of the french navy, which decided to upscale based on experience building nuclear reactors for submarines. while france has enjoyed success with nuclear subs, the ,  is widely believed to be underpowered relative to other fleet carriers. ,  uses two areva k15 reactors, the same type as employed on french submarines. these reactors provide 150 mw each, but only drive the 43,000-ton carrier some 27 knots. it’s worth noting that india considered, but wisely rejected, the idea of building ins vishal as a nuclear carrier, largely because of the technical challenges of developing a powerful enough reactor.\\\\n, the idea of using russian technical data and nuclear know-how certainly makes sense from the perspective of the people’s liberation army navy. the plan doesn’t have the luxury of the incremental approach adopted by the united states, and has good reason to find the french approach insufficient to its needs. that the russians seem okay with letting the chinese study their icebreakers suggests, once again, that moscow and beijing currently see cooperation as in their long-term interests. of course, nothing will be certain until china’s first nuclear carrier actually enters service, perhaps sometime around 2030.\\\\n, \\\\n,  , ©

put them in direct competition: yandex, the internet and search company, ,  the online bank tinkoff, while the banking giant sberbank unveiled a suite of technology products just two days later. as the ,  reported, “analysts also point out that russia is long-overdue a digitization surge, and there could easily be room for both to emerge winners.”, but behind this is another conflict—the kremlin’s ever expanding attempts to bring technology firms in russia under the state’s control. both companies have played a role in these efforts; yandex has been under kremlin ,  to give the russian government more influence over its decisions, and sberbank is a state-owned enterprise. (the latter is ,  by the u.s. government.) corporate takeovers such as yandex’s acquisition of tinkoff are pushing russia’s major tech companies into ever growing conglomerates, controlled either directly by the government or by other actors trusted to advance kremlin internet policy., but the kremlin’s toolkit of coercion is much broader, and more international, than this one tactic. the russian government has recognized the scale of political and economic power now wielded by internet companies and sought to channel that power toward its own ends., since russia’s 2014 war against ukraine, the russian government has carried out a rapidly escalating crackdown on internet freedom, but the hostile attitude toward freedom of information underlying russia’s internet policy has changed little since vladimir putin first took office in 2000. the kremlin’s strategy for the internet has in many ways mirrored the approaches used early in the putin era to bring russia’s major broadcast and print media—then the major means of information dissemination—under effective government control., at that time, the internet played no meaningful role in how most of the russian public read the news or communicated with one another and therefore escaped major attempts at government interference. in the 20 years since, however, as the importance of ,  dramatically in russia (as in most of the world), controlling the internet has become a higher priority for a government willing to use ever more authoritarian tactics., in addition to its efforts to control online media outlets, the russian government—in recognition of the internet’s power as a tool for communication—has prioritized maximizing its surveillance potential and enlisted social media and other tech companies in this push. through publicly enacted measures, it has created a legal and technological framework for the internet in russia under which only encryption (rather than any legal protection) can effectively prevent the authorities from viewing the content of any internet traffic within the country., a third goal, which receives surprisingly little attention relative to its potential significance, is to enlist russian internet companies in the government’s foreign espionage efforts. this topic may be downplayed due to well-justified cynicism: it would of course be naive to assume that the russian government is alone in such conduct, as authoritarian and democratic governments alike regularly demand user information, most often calling it necessary for the criminal justice process. but russia has had a unique case made public., in april 2014, pavel durov—the founder of vkontakte (now known as vk), russia’s most popular social media platform—,  he’d received the previous december from the country’s federal security service (fsb), which is responsible for domestic security but also foreign electronic surveillance. the letter demanded the personal data of users running popular vk groups involved in the ukrainian euromaidan protests, a movement that would ultimately result in the ouster of ukrainian president viktor yanukovych. the fsb’s demands demonstrate the power of the government to requisition user data from privately owned social media companies expressly in order to conduct espionage abroad., what sets this apart from the surveillance practices of most democratic governments (including the united states) is the lack of any political or legal checks that could serve to protect users’ privacy. when edward snowden’s 2013 disclosure of the prism program revealed that u.s. intelligence was collecting data from social media platforms, such surveillance became a major story in u.s. politics. u.s. tech companies ,  on their users’ behalf, changed their practices to better protect user data from government collection, and ,  to challenge its surveillance practices, earning praise from the american civil liberties union and other privacy activists. in russia, where the putin regime had already destroyed judicial independence, asserted control of most media outlets, and seriously weakened civil society, durov’s revelation had little impact on public discourse around surveillance, and the tech sector (already by that point largely under kremlin control) produced no comparable response., vk’s story is illustrative of many of the different tactics broadly employed by the russian government in its efforts to gain control. when durov published his letter from the fsb four months after receiving it, he had already fled russia. that final conflict was only the latest in a ,  between durov and the russian government that included an incident when durov refused a prosecutor’s order to take down vk pages being used to organize protests against russia’s fraudulent parliamentary elections, provoking a police special forces raid on his apartment., raids by masked and armed police on the offices of tech companies and the homes of their owners are a , —as they are to some extent in all profitable parts of the russian economy. these extortion tactics are often paired with corporate ownership maneuvers aimed at bringing those companies under the ownership of state-controlled companies or kremlin-friendly businessmen. in the case of vk, the personal pressure against durov occurred against a backdrop of a , —a russian tech giant owned by the billionaire and close putin ally alisher usmanov—to acquire a controlling stake in vk. when mail.ru ,  a few months after durov fled russia, the company added russia’s most popular social network to a product portfolio that already included its namesake email service (the most used webmail provider in russia) and odnoklassniki, the country’s second-most popular social network.,  corporate consolidation in the tech sector poses problems for freedom of expression and information everywhere. in russia, however, the primary driving force behind such consolidation is not the companies’ own economic motivations but rather the government’s political aims., in the case of mail.ru, these platforms were now under the control of an owner ready and willing to use his immense wealth and power to ,  and to , . that merger, however, was not the end of the kremlin’s use of corporate takeovers as an instrument to control the country’s tech giants. yandex, which in addition to operating russia’s most used search engine maintains a news aggregator that is the single-most popular news source on the russian internet and therefore a , , has similarly been subject to , . but yandex’s ,  did not directly result from these tactics; instead, the most proximate cause was the threat of new legislation that would limit or prohibit foreign ownership of russian tech companies., in this case, the relevant legislation was directly intended to pressure yandex into a corporate restructuring—evidenced by the fact that the legislation was introduced in 2018 during a sberbank takeover attempt and then withdrawn after yandex voluntarily restructured. other legislation, however, has constrained the activities of russian companies in a number of ways going well beyond ownership., the russian government surveillance system known by the acronym sorm has ,  infrastructure since the 1990s, with updates implemented to capture more internet and mobile phone communications as technology evolved. telecommunications companies have little ability to push back, as sorm gives the fsb the capability and the legal right to collect data from private companies without those companies’ knowledge., a 2012 law allowing russia’s internet oversight agency, roskomnadzor, to order the blocking of websites supposedly engaged in criminal activity ,  to censor political speech, leaving publishers and users of blocked sites no legal recourse. most recently, the “yarovaya” and “sovereign internet” laws—which entered into force in 2018 and 2019, respectively—have ,  and undermined any remaining legal or technical capacity that they might have to protect user privacy from surveillance or supply users with uncensored information, including from outside the country., all of this leads to a grim conclusion: barring dramatic political reforms, the russian tech business sector can no longer be a source of independent action on behalf of a free internet in russia, and russians seeking to use the internet for private communications and uncensored information will have to turn elsewhere. the outlook for international companies, while certainly more optimistic, is also less clear., moscow’s goals when it comes to international technology companies—those incorporated in other countries but operating in russia—are quite similar to those it pursues with domestic firms. authorities want to maximize surveillance potential, disrupt any possibility of domestic political unrest as a result of those companies’ content or services, and continue projecting disinformation through the internet., recent battles over data localization, or the mandated storage of certain kinds of data within russia’s borders, exemplify the kremlin’s desire to maximize its own surveillance potential through foreign companies. like many authoritarian governments that viewed the internet’s free information flows as a threat to regime security, moscow ,  in 2014 that companies with data on russian citizens store it locally. firms could maintain copies of the data elsewhere, but the data itself had to sit in russian servers, well within the broad legal and political jurisdiction of the russian security services described above. in recent years, u.s. companies like facebook and twitter have seemingly just ,  these orders and continued paying the trivial, court-ordered , , but pressures are likely to grow as putin further , ., russia’s moves to cement state control over data storage fit into a broader picture of government efforts to centralize internet data flows, designed at the internet’s inception to prioritize fast and reliable delivery above all else, to enable more effective government management and surveillance. though the process is often purely technical, the objectives are fundamentally political. in practice, these measures allow the russian government to surveil dissidents, ensure the privacy of russian citizen data against perceived malicious foreign access, and extend state information control in the digital domain., simultaneously justifying two of the kremlin’s other main goals in this sphere—disrupting the potential for political pluralism enabled by foreign tech platforms and projecting the state’s own disinformation through those same vectors—requires a kind of argumentative gymnastics. the russian government has for years required foreign internet companies operating in russia to remove content it deems “false.”, should companies not comply, the kremlin has vested powers in roskomnadzor to initiate technical blocks on those websites. although these blocks are often evaded or poorly implemented, the government has still managed to pressure foreign companies to ,  related to the covid-19 crisis. this minimizes the presence of state-critical or -contradictory information online in russia. at the same time, russian government propaganda outlets often have a large presence in major western platforms like twitter and youtube, and officials ,  anytime those firms take action against russian state-controlled news outlets., these inherent contradictions in the russian government’s approach to international tech companies—the kremlin wants these companies to operate in russia but only on the kremlin’s own terms; it pressures companies to suppress free speech inside russia but howls when russian government messaging abroad is met with wariness—mean that there is still space for international companies to effect a certain extent of internet freedom for russian citizens. this operating space, however, is under constant threat from the russian government and is likely to be the site of several major conflicts in coming years., first, international firms may continue to push back against certain elements of russian state internet control. u.s. firms that have mostly resisted complying with data localization rules have not indicated any changed willingness to follow kremlin pressure. though, resistance of this kind won’t apply to every area online; it’s important to not group different components of internet control here. content takedowns, for example, are one domain of internet control in the covid-19 pandemic where the russian government was quite successful in getting even u.s. social media companies to ,  from their platforms, within russia, that officials deemed “false.”, second, the struggle to maintain a “free internet” in russia will increasingly be defined by technical dimensions. the russian government in june decided to ,  on telegram, the encrypted messaging app, essentially ,  it lacked the technical capacity to block it. (ironically, this comprises a certain kind of payback for none other than pavel durov—telegram’s creator—who since losing vk and fleeing russia has built his messaging app into one of the world’s most popular.),  the sovereign internet law that came into force in 2019 ,  for developing pernicious new technical censorship capabilities, including—perhaps most ominously—the ability to selectively censor content on international social media platforms in russia while maintaining plausible deniability. it also required domestic internet companies to centralize their architecture so authorities could potentially cut off the russian internet from the rest of the world in the event of a security incident, broadly defined. thus, it will be incumbent on supporters of internet freedom to continue developing anti-censorship technology and maintain the kind of technical edge that has allowed telegram to continue operating in russia without compromising on surveillance or censorship. (full disclosure: one of the authors of this article works for a company that develops anti-censorship software.), and with moscow advancing internet control domestically, officials will continue seeking the normalization of this practice on the global stage. recently, these efforts have focused on the united nations, where ,  the russian state has proposed alternative cybercrime treaties that seek to justify its repressive internet policies and practices, clashing with free and open internet norms upheld by democracies worldwide. in december 2019, for the first time, one of these proposals , , an indicator of broader support among governments for tighter internet control. this was not an accidental occurrence. instead, it spotlights ,  to spread their authoritarian worldview and undermine a global free and open internet model amid much democratic uncertainty on the future of the internet., these outcomes should also serve as a reminder to tech companies, policymakers, and anyone who cares about maintaining an open global internet that internet freedom is neither inevitable nor permanent. russia’s domestic internet sector, once a model of pluralism and independent thought, has been thoroughly subverted to the ends of the government. as a once global internet splinters into , , it will take a concerted opposition effort to maintain international norms affirming that the internet should be a tool supporting rather than suppressing freedom of expression and information.,  is the director of business development for the newnode project at clostra and a

after decades of having no alternative to state-controlled tv, russians have increasingly begun to tune in to a new, fact-based reality online. thanks to youtube, serious, fair-minded journalists can now reach massive audiences and generate advertising revenue, and there is little the kremlin can do about it., moscow – television has occupied a prominent place in russian households for generations. relaxing while watching the news after a long day of work is a time-honored routine for many russians. you might scream back at the people on the screen, but you remain glued to it nonetheless. in the soviet era, the broadcasters would shamelessly lie across all six channels; today, they lie even more aggressively, and across even more channels., after surviving a grueling election campaign and a cliff-hanger election, joe biden will most likely enter the white house with a significant achievement under his belt, but little to look forward to. congressional republicans and a right-wing supreme court will ensure that any attempt at meaningful reform or governance is dead on arrival.\\\\xa0, the days-long wait for the outcome of the us presidential election reflected results that were far closer than expected. although joe biden emerged victorious, americans must reckon with the fact that nearly 70 million of their fellow citizens voted for a candidate who lacks any capacity for ethical reasoning., in fact, twenty-first-century russia has just one independent liberal tv channel: my employer, , , which has been ,  from main cable packages under pressure from the authorities. as a result, many russians cannot access us, and tend to resort to whatever is available, knowing full well that they can’t believe a word they hear from the “experts” and officials who appear there. they do so out of force of habit, inertia, and laziness – and may continue to do so for a long time., but even under conditions of widespread censorship and ceaseless propaganda, there are promising developments underway in russian journalism, thanks to the internet. the country has increasingly come to be divided between two parallel realities: the familiar post-soviet one, and a new one delivered by youtube, where one can watch live broadcasts of rallies and protests, deep investigations into official corruption, and interviews with people who have been blacklisted from state television channels., with serious journalism not only surviving but thriving online, russian authorities are gradually realizing that they must reckon with the real-world consequences of this new virtual world. consider the case of sergei furgal, who unexpectedly won the 2018 gubernatorial election in the far eastern city of khabarovsk even though he had no connection to the ruling party, united russia. in the ensuing two years, the kremlin sought to neutralize this political upstart by charging him for several murders committed in 2004-05. , much to the authorities’ surprise, furgal’s arrest triggered mass demonstrations in khabarovsk and many other cities. while the protests received only limited coverage on state tv channels, news about them spread like wildfire across social networks and youtube, where live broadcasts are targeted to a hipper, younger audience. but unlike in the soviet era, when the hacks on the screen could not hear you, those ,  read the comments and are responsive to viewer demand. though the protesters in khabarovsk were far from other population centers, they knew they were being watched – and supported – by millions of people across russia., back before youtube transformed russian politics, many journalists here had started to lose all hope of working in the profession. they understood that the choice was either to produce state propaganda or hazard the risks of pursuing genuine, public-interest journalism. if you chose the latter, the authorities would do whatever they could to ruin you financially., enjoy unlimited access

archive; and more – , ., \\\\r\\\\n , \\\\r\\\\n , but with youtube, one can make real money doing genuine journalism. aleksei pivovarov, a former star of state television, left that world in the mid-2010s and launched ,  on youtube in 2018. the channel now features serious coverage of critical national topics, following all the principles of old-fashioned journalism, with high-quality images, on-the-ground reporting, and interviews with parties on all sides of a given issue. with such content absent from russian television for so long, these online channels have quickly attracted millions of viewers, which translates into millions of rubles from advertising., moreover, the popularity of independent media on youtube explodes the myth that russians do not care about politics. youtube figures have quickly adapted in order to reach wider audiences. for example, yuri dud, a former sports journalist, has cultivated a large, intellectually curious, passionate following. initially featuring interviews with ,  and talk-show hosts, he has branched out into coverage of ,  and other figures., dud has had major successes with what once might have seemed like money-losing stories. for example, his videos on , , , , and the 2004 beslan school ,  have garnered tens of millions of views. equally important, dud’s audience is dominated not by the urban liberal intelligentsia but by schoolchildren and students. dud knows how to engage young people online, and he has been telling russia’s supposedly apolitical under-30s what is really happening in their country., finally, among the greatest success stories associated with the new media is russia’s main opposition leader, , , whom russian state tv did not even mention by name until very recently. in august, navalny was ,  with the nerve agent novichok and then airlifted to berlin for treatment, whereupon russian state media finally started acknowledging his existence, referring to him as the “berlin patient,” “hooligan on the internet,” and just a “blogger.” navalny, of course, has long been banned from state tv; but that is no longer a problem. he recently granted dud an interview from berlin, and that ,  received more than 15 million views within days of being released., there is no longer any doubt that youtube has become russia’s main platform for political journalism. and unlike on state tv, its leading voices cannot get away with shoddy work or mistakes, lest they lose viewers (and thus their chance at fame and fortune)., the big question, of course, is how long these online channels can stay open. as matters stand, post-soviet factotums still underestimate the power of youtube or are aware of it and know that an outright ban would bring people into the streets on a scale beyond anything seen in russia’s modern history., russia is not north korea. it is home to a generation of brave, free people who increasingly do not bother with state tv. and a growing number of older russians have begun to follow this generation’s lead. it doesn’t hurt that most tvs now can be connected to the internet, where a new, fact-based reality awaits viewers., as we await the results of the us presidential election, we are again reminded of the uncertainty and fear that pervade the current era. under such circumstances, , \" mission – delivering the highest-quality commentary on the worlds most pressing

among russian electronic media. , \"this is the real value of dozhd content. \", this is all readers need to know about press freedom in the west\\\\r\\\\n , \\\\r\\\\n according to ekaterina kotrikadze, television has been the most powerful sector of the media industry in russia and the main news source for most russians for generations - in the soviet era and today. even though the audience is aware of the lies, disinformation and propaganda aired on state-controlled tv, viewers glue themselves to the screens every day to relax after long hours of work. “they do so out of force of habit, inertia, and laziness,” and it is a “time-honored” routine for much of the population. , due to censorship, channels critical of the kremlin had been taken off air. today, russia has just “one independent liberal” tv channel: dozhd tv, the author’s employer, which “has been excluded from main cable packages.” hence, the independent tv station with a strong online presence is not available to many russians, and they “tend to resort to whatever is available, knowing full well that they can’t believe a word they hear from the “experts” and officials who appear there.” , the author says, the dominance of tv has been eroded by the internet in recent years. the total number of internet users in russia aged over 12 was 95 million in 2019, equating to more than 78% of the population, according to state-owned audience researcher mediascope. this has ushered in new “developments” in russian journalism. for decades viewers had no alternative to state-controlled tv. today, many can inform themselves online, learning facts and truths that have eluded them. , meanwhile russia “has increasingly come to be divided between two parallel realities: the familiar post-soviet one, and a new one delivered by youtube, where one can watch live broadcasts of rallies and protests, deep investigations into official corruption, and interviews with people who have been blacklisted from state television channels.” online networks monitored by serious journalists “have quickly attracted millions of viewers, which translates into millions of rubles from advertising.” this debunks the “myth” that russians “do not care about politics.”, for the time being, there is little the kremlin can do about this trend. the author points out that before youtube “transformed russian politics, many journalists here had started to lose all hope of working in the profession. they understood that the choice was either to produce state propaganda or hazard the risks of pursuing genuine, public-interest journalism. if you chose the latter, the authorities would do whatever they could to ruin you financially.” , the author sees the success of yuri dud, a former sports journalist, as a case in point. he “has cultivated a large, intellectually curious, passionate following. initially featuring interviews with rappers and talk-show hosts, he has branched out into coverage of politicians and other figures.” he also “knows how to engage young people online, and he has been telling russia’s supposedly apolitical under-30s what is really happening in their country.” his berlin interview earlier this month with russia’s most famous dissident, alexei navalny, who was airlifted to germany for medical treatment after being poisoned with novichok in august, has been watched over 15 million times within days. , “there is no longer any doubt that youtube has become russia’s main platform for political journalism. and unlike on state tv, its leading voices cannot get away with shoddy work or mistakes, lest they lose viewers (and thus their chance at fame and fortune).” it is a gift for journalists that they can combine making money and engaging in serious journalism on youtube, and that russian authorities are also “gradually realizing that they must reckon with the real-world consequences of this new virtual world,”, as putin has gone to extreme lengths to control the flow of information in russia, it raises the “big question… how long these online channels can stay open. as matters stand, post-soviet factotums still underestimate the power of youtube or are aware of it and know that an outright ban would bring people into the streets on a scale beyond anything seen in russia’s modern history.” , the author remains optimistic, insisting that, “russia is not north korea. it is home to a generation of brave, free people who increasingly do not bother with state tv. and a growing number of older russians have begun to follow this generation’s lead. it doesn’t hurt that most tvs now can be connected to the internet, where a new, fact-based reality awaits viewers.”, so far there is one step putin has not yet taken: shutting down youtube. one of his first initiatives upon taking office 20 years ago was to bring russia’s independent tv networks under his control. as youtube has replaced tv in the news and entertainment diets of russians under 30, it has become the go-to platform for putin’s critics. while the internet is less tightly controlled than traditional media, russia has made moves to restrict online freedoms, playing a cat-and-mouse game with critics.\\\\r\\\\n , \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n it appears that you have not yet updated your first and last name. if you would like to update your name, please

production of the cold war-era missile-carrier. since no photos of the re-engined bomber have so far been released, it’s not yet possible to determine the identity of the particular blackjack, or whether all four of the turbofans are already installed., the united aircraft corporation, which now has manufacturing responsibility for the blackjack, announced that the “deeply modernized” tu-160m had performed its first flight with its new serial-production nk-32-02 engines at the kazan aircraft production association airfield in southwest russia on november 3, 2020. the flight lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes and saw the bomber climb to a height of over 19,000 feet, with the crew led by test pilot anri naskidyants., russian state-owned news agency , reported that the flight went smoothly, adding that the aircraft “was equipped with new flight and navigation equipment, an onboard communications system, modernized control system, radar, and , .”, lack of engines had been a serious hurdle in moscow’s ambitious plans to restart production of the blackjack, which had originally come to a halt in 1994 after just 36 examples - three of them non-flying static test airframes - had been completed. with the collapse of the soviet union, 10 of the tu-160s left in ukrainian territory were scrapped. another four of the bombers were left unfinished on the assembly line and two of these were eventually completed in 1999 and 2007. today, the russian aerospace forces fleet is thought to include around 17 blackjacks, which have performed a number of high-profile ,  in recent years, as well as regular “patrol” flights , ., then, in april 2015, russian minister of defense sergey shoygu announced that production of the tu-160 was to be resumed. ahead of this, the ,  company in russia’s southwestern city of samara received a contract to restart production of the blackjack’s nk-32 turbofans, now producing an improved nk-32-02 version. the first of these engines was planned to be ready for tests in 2016 and some observers have expected that the same powerplant to be used in russia’s still-secretive and still-unseen pak da new-generation bomber. as well as powering new-build blackjacks, the nk-32-02 is required to keep tu-160s from the original production run operational., one of the tu-160s from the original production run, , over the river volga during a mission from its home base at engels in the saratov region., the kuznetsov nk-32, as installed in the original tu-160, is widely reported as the most powerful combat aircraft engine in the world, developing over 55,000 pounds of thrust at full afterburner.\\\\xa0, while the nk-32-02 is considered a “new” engine, it actually dates back to the mid-1980s, when the soviet union canceled its production on cost grounds. the improvements over the initial design included new blades for the compressor and turbine, plus more efficient cooling., the nk-32-02 is understood to have the same output as the original powerplant but offers increased efficiency, extending the bomber’s range by around 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, according to russian media reports. tupolev has in the past claimed a 13 percent overall range increase. \\\\xa0, the program to get the blackjack back into production has been a protracted one, perhaps not altogether surprisingly, as the effort to reinstate a production line and setup required tooling after decades of inactivity is considerable. in january 2018, the russian ministry of defense signed a contract for the next 10 new-build blackjacks, which cost around $270 million per copy. plans called for a first example for the russian aerospace forces to be rolled out in 2021; according to , , this schedule is still on track., in the past, the russian aerospace forces have declared a requirement for ,  new-build tu-160m aircraft., one of the russian aerospace forces’ original batch of tu-160s undergoes overhaul in kazan in 2016., in parallel with the new-production blackjacks, russia has been busy with a mid-life upgrade program for its existing tu-160s, including new mission systems and avionics. originally, the existing bombers were to be designated tu-160m after completing their upgrade, while the new-build aircraft would be designated tu-160m2. this has now been rationalized, and both variants are now known as tu-160ms., therefore, the first aircraft to be re-engined with the new nk-32-02 turbofans is not a new-build blackjack, but either an example from the earlier production batch that has been brought up to tu-160m status or a prototype for the new-build aircraft constructed using one of the two incomplete airframes from the original production run., one of these two unfinished aircraft has been completed as a tu-160m, perhaps to serve as a proof-of-concept for the new-build bombers. this aircraft was ,  and began flight trials in january 2018. it is named ,  after the former russian air force chief., the most recent blackjack to be completed is , , which has been finished to tu-160m standard., meanwhile, a first “deeply modernized” tu-160m based on an aircraft from the original production series — named ,  — performed its maiden flight at kazan in february 2020. the aircraft was originally built in february 1989 and was one of eight blackjacks purchased by russia from ukraine in 1999, after the fleet had been left there following the dissolution of the soviet union., \"the full tu-160m configuration includes a new novella radar as well as a new self-defense suite and electronic surveillance system. the flight deck is now equipped with a glass cockpit and the revised avionics encompass the communication suite, flight control system, and navigation suite.\", alongside the “deeply modernized” tu-160m, russia has also been performing a less-extensive upgrade on its blackjack fleet, at a rate of one or two aircraft per year. this is the so-called “small modernization,” or tu-160m1, and provides a digital upgrade for the aircraft’s inertial navigation and engine control systems, as well as armament., russia’s deputy prime minister yuri borisov has said the russian aerospace forces will continue to operate modernized tu-160ms (both upgraded and new-build examples) “until the 2050s or even the 2060s.”\\\\xa0, considering the blackjack can now deploy conventional weapons, as well as nuclear ones, and have been ,  in the syrian campaign, it’s unsurprising that russia wants to get the most out of its supersonic strategic bombers.\\\\xa0, on the other hand, the continued focus on the blackjack — including the tricky task of bringing it back into production — should be seen against the prospects for the future pak da, which stands for perspektivnyi aviatsionnyi kompleks dalney aviatsii, or future air complex of long-range aviation.\\\\xa0, the research and development program for the pak da began around 2009, ,  the order to resume tu-160 production. that suggests that difficulties faced by the pak da program led to the new bomber program’s priority being reduced in favor of the tried and tested blackjack., to this day, there has been no official concept art of the pak da, so we really have no idea what the design looks like. however, most observers expect that it will be a subsonic “flying wing” design, possibly with low-observable (stealthy) features., tupolev’s concept for the pak da was apparently approved in 2013, after which the united aircraft corporation received a follow-on contract for detailed design work and other contracts to develop the aircraft’s systems. the then commander of russia’s long-range aviation branch, anatoly zhikharev, said in late 2014 that a pak da prototype would fly in 2019., in 2015, however, the idea of resuming series production of the tu-160 appeared and with this, the urgency assigned to the pak da seems to have diminished. indeed, speaking in 2018, deputy prime minister borisov described that relaunching production of the blackjack was “a less risky path” than the pak da. “at the same time, we have postponed the pak da, to gain experience and restore technology”, he added. borisov’s predecessor, dmitry rogozin, had the same year said that the pak da would perform its first flight in 2023 or 2024., the prospects of the pak da taking to the air in that kind of timeframe seem remote, especially as the focus is now on the tu-160’s continued upgrade and production restart, which will consume both funding and production capacity at the kazan plant. meanwhile, similar upgrade programs for the ,  and ,  strategic bombers further reduce the urgency of getting the pak da into service.\\\\xa0, there is also the enormous cost involved in getting a sophisticated “clean-sheet” design into production and service in meaningful numbers. moscow’s planned purchases of ,  new-generation fighters currently stand at just 76 and other expensive weapons programs have been , .\\\\xa0, while the pak da looks like it will have to wait in the wings sometime longer, the “new” tu-160 will, at least, provide the russian aerospace forces with a very capable stopgap., sign up for our newsletter, technology, performance and design delivered to your inbox., © ,  ,  all rights reserved., we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an

threat comes from the white house, \\\\n, \\\\n, \\\\n, it seemed like the nightmare of 2016 all over again., on 21 october, less than two weeks before election day, us intelligence and law enforcement officials convened a last-minute ,  to warn that foreign adversaries were once again interfering in american democracy. iran was spreading false tales about “allegedly fraudulent ballots” and sending spoofed emails purporting to contain threats from the proud boys, “designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage president trump”, said john ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence. meanwhile, both russia and iran had obtained access to voter information that could be used to “cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in american democracy”, he warned., it was everything that democrats and disinformation experts have been warning about for the last four years, except, well, not quite., the email operation had been relatively small and immediately debunked, while voter roll information is either public or easy to obtain. senior intelligence officials quickly raised doubts about ratcliffe’s emphasis on the threat from iran over russia and questioned whether his motives for the public announcement were political, the ,  reported., “it was very difficult to see those men in suits talking about interference in the election when the white house is the one interfering with the election,” said claire wardle, the executive director of first draft, a group that researches and combats disinformation., after all, when it comes to intimidating voters or inciting social unrest, nothing has had more impact than the constant drumbeat of lies and disinformation from , . years of preparation by the press, social media platforms, and civil society groups for a foreign interference campaign against the us electoral process have been upended by the bizarre reality that the biggest threat to american democracy right now is almost certainly the commander-in-chief, and that his primary mode of attack is a concerted disinformation campaign., because how much impact can a ,  telling voters in florida and alaska to “vote for trump or else” have on voters compared with trump directly ,  the proud boys, a neo-fascist street gang, to “stand back and stand by” before a television ,  of 73 million people? and what kind of false tale of voter fraud could iran possibly seed that could undermine americans’ faith in the electoral process more than the disinformation about voter fraud and mail-in ballots coming straight from the white house and trump’s campaign?, “‘don’t trust the electoral system, don’t trust the cdc, don’t trust your neighbor because they’re probably antifa, don’t trust the left,’” wardle said of trump’s re-election message. “it’s not about persuading people one way or the other, it’s about making them scared and causing confusion and chaos,” she added., “the media’s been obsessed with russians under the bed, but to have the president of the united states telling people in the us that they can’t trust the results of the election – putin could only dream of that kind of thing.”, russia’s disinformation campaign in the 2016 presidential election had two main vectors: a social media campaign to sow division and distrust among voters, and a “hack and leak” operation that resulted in the theft and publication of emails and documents stolen from democrats and hillary clinton’s campaign. that hack and leak operation was incredibly successful, with caches of stolen material proving irresistible both for the mainstream press and for conservative activists and conspiracy theorists., people have been overwhelmed with falsehoods and confusion. when people get overwhelmed, they either fight or flee, the 2020 iteration of the hack and leak tactic – trump’s attorney rudy giuliani pushing dubious emails and text messages supposedly obtained from a hard drive linked to joe biden’s son hunter – has been something of a damp squib, however. “you don’t see the same kind of credulous, knee-jerk out-of-control amplification that you saw in 2016,” said whitney phillips, a professor at syracuse university and author of , , a report examining how the press served the purposes of media manipulators, trolls and hate groups in 2016. the top newspapers have debunked and deflated giuliani’s claims, and the idea of the pilfered hard drive has failed to capture the public’s interest in the same way that troves of stolen emails did., but while the trump re-election campaign may have failed to recapture the magic of 2016 when it comes to hacked emails, the president has taken russia’s 2016 social media playbook and supercharged it with the power of the white house., “i’m sure that there is some foreign influence stuff happening and we might know more about it later,” said phillips. “but so much of the pollution is trickling down from the white house itself, and people have been absolutely overwhelmed with falsehoods and confusion over covid and ballots … when people get overwhelmed, they either fight or flee. [trump] is making it almost impossible for people not to get totally burned out and disgusted.”, this year’s disinformation efforts on social media have taken aim at familiar societal fault lines. both russian operatives and the ,  in 2016 targeted ,  with messages designed to depress enthusiasm for clinton and suppress their votes. similar efforts, especially those , , are under way this election, said shireen mitchell, a disinformation researcher and founder of stop online violence against women., “there are groups working to basically remove us from the democratic party, and tell us a story that matches what we’re going through, speaks our language,” said mitchell of campaigns such as “blexit” and walk away. one version of black voter suppression that mitchell is monitoring encourages people to #votedownballot but abstain from voting for either presidential candidate because “both candidates are the same”, often alongside the hashtag #ados, which stands for american descendants of slaves., jacobo licona, a disinformation researcher for equis labs, said he was tracking prominent far-right latino facebook pages pushing false information about voting and anti-black lives matter messages. efforts to paint biden as a “socialist” are also particularly effective among cuban and venezuelan immigrant communities, he noted., the false idea that biden is a socialist or communist is also a tactic in messages targeting some asian american voters. one apparently effective attack suggesting that biden had opposed accepting refugees after the vietnam war spread like wildfire within the vietnamese american community. the source of the canard appeared to be a ,  article that was published in 2019 but went viral on facebook in october. (biden did support allowing vietnamese refugees to come the us, while trump has attacked all forms of immigration, including reducing the number of refugees admitted each year to an , .), “older vietnamese were especially angry about that,” said thu quach, an epidemiologist who helped to found , , a progressive, volunteer organization fighting misinformation among vietnamese americans through a bilingual , . “it takes a lot of deep work to continue these conversations because it’s so deeply embedded to be anti-communist, and [conservatives] feed off that to paint biden and harris as communists.”, tech platforms, after belatedly and begrudgingly admitting their tools had been used to ill ends in 2016, have made reforms that make some of the old tactics obsolete. the trump campaign’s 2016 use of facebook to target black voters with voting “deterrence” messages, recently confirmed by a , , is the kind of digital dirty trickery that should no longer be possible., every newsroom should be very, very careful about what they publish, because they are going to become tools in the fight, such reforms may be one reason trump has been so openly fanning the flames of political violence, whether through his debate message to the proud boys or his call for his supporters to become “poll watchers”, said joan donovan, research director at harvard’s shorenstein center on media, politics and public policy., “they’ve had to adapt to a more mass media strategy,” she said of the trump campaign. “if you can’t utilize those other mechanisms, then you have to use the megaphone.”, trump’s blatant racism and ugly attacks on black women, including the democratic vice-presidential nominee, kamala harris, and the congresswoman ilhan omar, could also have the effect of suppressing turnout among black voters, phillips said, simply by demoralizing people and inducing despair. “if certain people feel just crushed under the weight of so much bullshit, [trump] is going to be the one to benefit,” she said., even as volunteers like quach work to fight false narratives and voter confusion ahead of election day, however, experts warn that the greatest scope for disinformation may still be to come. the surge in mail-in ballots is likely to delay the final results, and trump has repeatedly telegraphed his intention to declare premature victory – or dismiss the election as “rigged”. , “i think we’re going to look back at 2020 and realize that it’s all going to play out from 11.30pm on tuesday,” said wardle. “misinformation flourishes when there’s a vacuum or confusion, and my fear is that there will be a lot of confusion and whoever succeeds in controlling the narrative will be very well placed.”, in 2000, al gore never fully recovered from television networks’ premature declaration that george w bush had won florida, wardle noted. “that made all the difference,” she said., “we know that trump’s closest circle is ready to deploy. we know that the militias are ready to deploy. what we don’t know is if newsrooms are ready for the absence of information,” wardle added. “every newsroom should be very, very careful about what they publish, because they are going to become tools in the fight, and it’s going to be nasty.”][energy minister says moscow will also focus on clean-burning hydrogen and carbon capture, \\\\n, \\\\n, \\\\n,  has no plans to rein in its production of fossil fuels in the coming decades despite the global efforts to shift towards low-carbon energy, according to its energy minister., alexander novak told the guardian that russia did “not see that we will achieve a peak in [gas] production anytime soon” because the world’s appetite for gas would continue to grow in the decades ahead despite its growing number of climate targets., instead, during ,  in the battle to keep a lid on rising global temperatures, russia will pair a 50% growth in gas production with plans to become a global leader in producing ,  and developing , technology., russia intends to ramp up gas production from its vast and inexpensive reserves to reach 1tn cubic meters a year by 2035, from just under 680bn cubic meters last year., it also plans to increase the amount of gas it exports on giant super-chilled tankers more than four-fold, from 29m tonnes a year to 120-140m tonnes, while continuing to send about 200bn cubic meters of gas to europe via pipelines including the , ., “i believe natural gas to be an eco-friendly energy source,” said novak. “we believe that the share of natural gas in the global energy mix will only increase. we believe this to apply not only to , , but globally too.”, energy economists forecast that demand for gas will continue to grow, particularly in asia, as more countries draw a line on burning coal, which emits almost double the carbon dioxide of gas. but eu demand for gas, of which 30% is met by russia’s state gas monopoly gazprom, could fall 8% below 2019 levels by the end of the decade, according to , ., novak said russia also planned to become a global player in the hydrogen economy, by producing and transporting the clean-burning alternative to traditional fossil fuel gas., hydrogen can be produced either by using renewable energy to split water molecules in a process known as electrolysis, or by splitting off the carbon dioxide from gas through pyrolysis. novak said russia was able to do both and was also developing technology to capture the carbon emissions created during hydrogen production to offer a genuinely “green” gas to its customers using russia’s existing gas transport channels., “all this has been quite expensive so far, but we believe that just like with the renewable energy sources, , , which will determine the pace of hydrogen adoption. to put it briefly, we can produce hydrogen and use it, as well as deliver it to consumers. we can also export the hydrogen production technologies,” novak said., pursuing hydrogen production would safeguard russia’s fossil fuel economy while helping to reduce emissions worldwide. but environmental groups, including carbon action tracker, have nonetheless branded russia’s climate plans , ., the emissions targets set through the paris agreement are set against levels in 1990, which for russia marked its highest emissions on record. the collapse of soviet-era industries in the early 1990s halved the country’s emissions within a matter of years, meaning it would take very little effort for the kremlin to record emissions which are between 25-30% lower than levels in 1990 by 2030., novak said: “we are working very actively in russia, pursuing the climate agenda, working to decrease the greenhouse and co2 emissions, and we’re working on these issues on a systematic basis.”][updated

forage for berries and mushrooms. corruption was rife—one general was charged with renting out a , i, -29 for illicit drag racing between cars and jets on a german airfield. “no army in the world is in as wretched a state as ours,” lamented a defence minister in 1994. yet few armies have bounced back as dramatically. in 2008 russian forces bungled a war with georgia. in response, they were transformed from top to bottom., that began with large sums of money. russian military expenditure roughly doubled between 2005 and 2018, when measured in exchange rates adjusted for purchasing power. though much of the budget is secret, russia’s annual military spending probably stands somewhere between $150bn and $180bn, says michael kofman of the centre for naval analyses, a think-tank in virginia. that is around three times as much as britain and close to 4% of , ., much of that money has been spent on kit. in the past decade russia has added around 600 new planes, 840 helicopters and 2,300 drones, estimates julian cooper of the university of birmingham. whereas 99% of russian armour in 2007 was classified as “legacy”—ie, introduced into service more than three decades ago—today fully 27% is modern, according to a study published by the international institute for strategic studies (, ), a think-tank in london, on september 29th. russia’s warplanes have gone from being 97% legacy to being 71% modern in that time., the key investments were in precision missiles like the land-based iskander, sea-launched kalibr and air-launched kh-101, putting in range targets across europe (see map). a decade ago the idea that the russian navy could accurately hit targets in syria from warships in the caspian sea would have been science fiction, notes dmitry stefanovich of , , a research institute in moscow. “now it’s a reality.” in a european war, the idea would be to use such missiles to threaten civilian and military infrastructure deep behind the front lines on the ground, ensuring that a conflict over, say, tallinn would stretch far to the west of the rhine., russia’s ultimate aim is to create a “reconnaissance-strike complex”—originally a soviet idea—in which data from vehicles on the ground, drones in the air, satellites in space and radio signals emitted by enemy units are collected, processed and fed into the weapons in real time. any “sensor” (for instance, a drone) can feed a target to any “shooter” (like a faraway ship), with targets prioritised centrally and struck, ideally, within minutes. though russia is behind america and probably china in this ambitious endeavour, it has made “huge leaps”, says dima adamsky of ,  herzliya, a university in israel., russian forces are not just better armed, but also more fleet-footed. thanks to improvements in readiness, russia could probably get 100,000 troops, complete with heavy armour, to a european hotspot within 30 days. ,  might struggle to muster half the number, of lighter forces, in that time. around 5,000 of russia’s airborne troops are said to be on two hours’ notice. soldiers are kept on their toes with huge exercises. the latest, kavkaz (caucasus) 2020, involved 80,000 personnel and concluded on september 26th. “russia has traded mass for tempo,” concludes lt-general jim hockenhull, britain’s chief of defence intelligence., russia’s armed forces enjoy the additional advantage of being blooded in battle. though russia and china may have comparable weapons, the quality of the forces, in training and combat experience, is “night and day”, says mr kofman. in ukraine, for instance, russia has practised armoured warfare and artillery duels, experimenting with the use of cyber-attacks and drones to feed targeting information to its guns. syria, where over 63,000 russian personnel have served, has been a testbed for precision strikes, air defence against rebel drone swarms, and the use of unmanned vehicles., russian officers in syria have even shown signs of shedding the soviet legacy of rigid, top-down command and acting with more autonomy and creativity, a practice known as “mission command”, observes mr adamsky. that, he says, would be “a major departure from the russian military tradition”. and in both countries, russia has honed its skills in electronic warfare by jamming radios, radars and drones. russia’s fake ,  signals in syria were even strong enough to bamboozle civilian airliners in israel., not everything has been fixed, of course. viktor murakhovsky, a former officer who now edits a military journal, is positive about the reforms. but he says that shipbuilding is slow and that the country lags behind its rivals in long-range drones. the new , -14 armata tank, the next-generation su-57 warplane and new submarines have all been delayed. though russia is adept at blowing things up in space, its ageing fleet of reconnaissance satellites has shrunk over the years, with modernisation complicated by western sanctions. the biggest problem of all, says mr kofman, is the limited capacity of russia’s defence industry, including shortages of skilled personnel, machine tools and components., the trade-off between hardware and humans is also apparent. though troops no longer go hungry, their pay is not great. mr murakhovsky points out that a skilled tank commander in his 20s can expect little more than 43,000 rubles ($532) a month in peacetime, lower than the national average. “in my opinion, it’s not enough.” morale among conscripts, who still make up 55% of ground forces, remains low, and the short duration of their service limits their usefulness in combat. though the days of renting out warplanes may be over, last year russian military prosecutors announced that 2,800 military officials had been charged with corruption. the amount stolen totalled around $90m., nor has military renaissance bought peace of mind. in a war with , , russia “would have conventional superiority for a limited period”, concludes the , , but would be outgunned if the conflict dragged on. in recent years, mr putin has therefore worked to ensure that a conflict would not drag on. he has invested heavily in nuclear forces, unveiling a host of lurid weapons such as hypersonic gliders, radioactive torpedos designed to pollute coastal areas and nuclear-powered cruise missiles capable of circling the earth indefinitely. missiles like the iskander, kalibr and kh-101 can also carry both conventional and nuclear warheads (,  officials point out that they would have no way of knowing which until they landed). for russian generals, the hope is that their revived strength means that the nukes are never needed., for its part, ,  has largely focused on russian threats to the baltic states, and the challenges of reinforcing europe over weeks and months. it has underestimated how russia’s new firepower may be used in a shorter, sharper and more expansive war that would stretch far beyond the baltics. its planners, and the national politicians that set military budgets and priorities, need to adjust their strategies and spending in the light of these new threats. , this article appeared in

“people are acting like they are invincible, like they were already victorious, nobody is taking basic precautions,” said maria, a paediatrician from chelyabinsk, where infections increased sharply in september. “conditions are just as bad as they were in spring, nothing has changed.”, a hospital doctor in the hard-hit altai region described pressure to discharge patients because of a lack of beds. russia’s deputy prime minister, tatiana golikova, told putin on wednesday that 16 regions were in a critical situation with more than 90% of hospital beds occupied. five of them were at more than 95% of capacity., experts are hesitant to call it a second wave. they say that in most regions the first wave never truly receded. the data in recent weeks, however, has been extremely alarming., “it’s much worse than in the first months,” said alexey raksha, an independent demographer who previously worked for the government statistics agency rosstat. he cited rising official tallies, past data on excess deaths and experimental data collated by colleagues that shows an increasing number of internet searches for coronavirus symptoms. “i’m expecting huge excess mortality in october and unprecedented in november,” he said., excess mortality refers to the number of people who die in a given period above a past average, and it is an alternative way to estimate the toll taken by the coronavirus. reuters reported last month that excess mortality in ,  from may to july was more than triple the official number of coronavirus deaths, leaving tens of thousands of deaths unexplained., raksha criticised tallies published on the government’s stopcoronavirus website, saying they should be “multiplied by four to get a much clearer picture”. the country’s current death toll is 27,656, but an estimate based on a proportion of excess mortality since april would put it between 120,000 and 130,000, he said., russian agencies have taken steps to block leaks. the health ministry has barred employees, including many doctors, from speaking to the media without coordinating with its press office. data on deaths from the regions can take months to reach the public., many civil registration offices had stopped reporting data on deaths, raksha said, citing instances in ten regions, particularly those hard-hit by the virus. “we need something better. the official statistics are not up to it.”, the russian government has defended its conservative methodologies, including the requirement that coronavirus diagnoses be confirmed by an autopsy. the lack of qualified pathologists to perform them is part of the official reason for the buildup of bodies in regional hospitals. officials say a lack of morgue space and families’ slowness to retrieve bodies are also factors., russia has, however, resisted declaring a new coronavirus lockdown. “we’re not planning sweeping restrictive measures, the initiation of a so-called nationwide lockdown, which would lead to practically a complete shutdown of the economy and business operations,” putin said at an investment conference on thursday., sergei sobyanin, the influential mayor of moscow, said: “i very much hope that none of the severe measures being applied in , , in france, germany and other countries, will be applied here.”][support the news, a new report finds that president trump and the republican party

support the news, support the news][war and revolution are not inimical to moscow if they follow paths russian policymakers understand and even support. , \\\\n, \\\\n, \\\\n, the current unrest in different parts of the former soviet union may make it tempting to ,  that russia is losing control over its neighbourhood. and it is true that over some areas its hold has weakened – russia’s loss of ukraine is undeniable and serious. however, the current ructions do not mark a decline, but demonstrate rather the opposite: russia is working on settlements for nagorno-karabakh and belarus, and doing so according to its own principles. meanwhile, the west lacks workable leverage over either issue., russia may appear on the back foot if one misunderstands its aims, by assuming that in nagorno-karabakh it stands unconditionally behind armenia – its collective security treaty organisation ally whose control of nagorno-karabakh in azerbaijan relies on russia’s military support. it is also wrong to assume that, in belarus, moscow stands fully behind alyaksandr lukashenka – the authoritarian leader who has long declared his friendship towards russia, though not always lived up to it. in fact, moscow is quite tired of lukashenka’s two-faced behaviour, and would like to see a change in minsk. it might also accept some change in nagorno-karabakh – as long as it happens on moscow’s terms, or at least on terms understandable to moscow. \\\\xa0, russia’s true aim in these neighbourhood conflicts is not to back particular sides or personalities, but to defend the principles it values. it wants to delegitimise bottom-up revolutions as a means of transferring power; it also wants to signal that western interventionism with its promotion of democracy and normative approach are unfruitful in general, and unwelcome around russia in particular. what is playing out is essentially the same philosophy that guided russia’s intervention in syria – and if judged against these criteria, moscow is doing well enough, at least at the moment., moscow wants to delegitimise bottom-up revolutions as a means to arrange transfers of power, in belarus, for instance, moscow might be backing lukashenka for now, but in reality it is already working on his replacement. this process will take some time; lukashenka will have some say over the terms of his exit. a recent meeting he held with opposition figures in jail was probably part of this process. svitlana tsikhanouskaya, though – the opposition leader now based in lithuania and the likely real winner of the rigged election – has probably been prescribed the role of bystander by moscow. and so has europe. from the start, moscow has shunned all european calls for due procedure, respect for human rights, and mediation by the osce. vladimir putin last week encapsulated his country’s position, though somewhat hypocritically, when he , : “russia did not interfere in\\\\xa0what was happening [in belarus]. and\\\\xa0we expect no one else to\\\\xa0interfere either. no one should be stirring up this conflict to\\\\xa0promote their own interests and\\\\xa0impose any decisions on\\\\xa0the\\\\xa0belarusian people.”\\\\xa0, nagorno-karabakh is a different type of conflict, of an ethnic-territorial kind, and the new onslaught of fighting – with an azerbaijan emboldened by turkish support – might suggest that russia is facing a rival power in its neighbourhood. but for many in moscow the advantage of having the west out still outweighs the nuisance of having turkey in. moscow knows ankara and has learned to work with it. the two capitals are far from being allies: their goals in the middle east often stand in direct opposition to each other. but both realise they need each other, as they cannot achieve their aims without some acquiescence from the other. and most importantly, the turkish government is motivated by goals that in the kremlin’s eyes are rational: strengthening its power at home, enhancing its leverage abroad, and pursuing economic and security interests. it lacks any western-style rule-centric approach and instead subscribes to a worldview that moscow understands., azerbaijan, too, has pursued its foreign policy without challenging russia’s philosophical standpoint or historical narratives even though at times it has been at odds with moscow. this is why russia might be more relaxed than expected, even though its armenian ally is in trouble: “russia may have reasons to help its ally armenia, but it has no reason at all to punish azerbaijan, which has been an example of model behavior among the former soviet states, as far as russia is concerned”, ,  carnegie scholar alexander baunov. in nagorno-karabakh, it is again moscow that has brought the warring sides together and arranged for a ceasefire, though an admittedly shaky one. the western members of the contact group have largely been , ., europeans have tried different ways to influence the situation in belarus. lithuania, for instance, has positioned itself on the moral high ground, arranged public shows of solidarity with the belarusian opposition, and called for harsh sanctions against the regime. france has ,  on dialogue with putin, trying to get the latter to accept osce mediation. collectively, eu leaders made great efforts in august to signal to moscow their restraint and desire not to ‘geopoliticise’ the conflict – in the hope that moscow would mirror the position, thus allowing for an ‘armenian-style’ political transition with no geopolitical contest around it., all to no avail. after adopting a wait-and-see position for around two weeks after the election, moscow made up its mind and embarked on a strategy of transition – one that saves some face for lukashenka; deepens russia’s leverage in the country; brings to power a leader acceptable to moscow; keeps both the west and the osce at arm’s length; and, most importantly, demonstrates that popular revolution is not an effective way to transfer power. one can imagine scenarios under which moscow could reconsider its approach, change strategy, and even reach out to the lithuania-based opposition. but all these would stem from developments inside belarus itself – such as strikes that paralyse the country, or the regime splitting and crumbling – rather than something the west does or says.\\\\xa0, the lesson for the west is clear enough: to influence post-soviet – or any – crises, one needs to have true leverage: either on the regional level, or on the global level that it can convert to regional influence. if one relies solely on good principles and the moral high ground, it is very easy to be outmanoeuvred in the face of a determined opponent., \\\\nthe

siberia are growing, fueled by fears around chinese investment and resentment at being governed from another continent., a demonstration in support of governor sergei furgal in khabarovsk, july 12, 2020., khabarovsk, the largest city in russia’s far east, is known for its classical architecture, winter ice sculptures, and now, the country’s longest running protest. for more than a hundred consecutive days, thousands have taken to the streets waving flags, holding pickets and staging marches., the protests were sparked in july by the arrest of the region’s former governor, sergei furgal. a charismatic businessman and local politician, furgal scored a surprise electoral victory over his predecessor vyacheslav shport, the kremlin’s preferred candidate, in 2018. in dramatic scenes earlier this year, he was pulled out of his car and arrested by federal officers, who had been flown in directly from moscow. he stands accused of involvement in a series of murders of business rivals in the region in the early 2000s., the incident has since become a focus point for frustrations in the far east. while protestors initially demanded furgal’s release from the moscow jail where he is being held and for his case to be tried locally, their chants are now more often broad criticisms of both president vladimir putin and moscow. many commentators have been quick to speculate that these protests – in a region where they had previously been unheard of – mark the beginning of an organized, moderate alternative to putin’s russia. however, the reality is far more complex., the liberal democratic party of russia, to which furgal and his allies belong, is far from that moderate movement. in reality, it has tended more toward ultranationalism than liberalism, calling for russian expansion into ukraine and belarus. in 2013, the party’s representatives in the state duma proposed a bill banning the use of foreign loanwords, which would have fined politicians and the public for using english words when there is a russian alternative. the initiative failed to gain support., get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the asia-pacific., instead, while those taking to the street have vented frustrations at the kremlin, their complaints appear to be less about domestic policy than regional autonomy. the scion of a prominent khabarovsk family, furgal’s local credentials were key to his popular support. as one protestor pointed out, “normally the governors are sent to the region from moscow… but furgal was different. he helped us.” his arrest – and the appointment of mikhail degtyarev, a moscow politician, as his interim replacement – created a narrative that the kremlin was interfering in local affairs from afar., russia’s expansive east, beginning at the urals and stretching through siberia to the sea of japan, has long had an uneasy balance with its western center. since the days of imperial russia, its towns and cities have been seen as a mere extension of the european nation – an asian frontier to be settled and tamed. as part of the soviet union, mass deportations eastwards and its status as a destination for gulag prisoners reinforced that notion. but now, as the protesters in khabarovsk show, russia’s far east might be forming its own identity., one major point of contention is that while eastern russia holds much of the country’s natural resources – including oil, gas, and rare earth metals – the proceeds from their extraction are widely seen to line pockets in the west, rather than enriching local communities. a series of environmental catastrophes in the far east, such as a petrochemical spill that led to the ,  in october, angered locals who feel like they are being left to pick up the pieces., while russia is often stereotyped as ethnically homogeneous, around 10 percent of siberians are from minority ethnic groups, and the far east is home to more than 25 distinct cultures. unlike the rest of the country, protestant congregations far outnumber those belonging to the moscow-based orthodox church. in the 19th century, ukrainians were encouraged to settle along the southeastern limits of the far east, from the border with china to the sea of okhotsk. the scheme was so successful that, after the bolshevik revolution of 1917, ukrainian-majority areas centered on khabarovsk attempted to declare their independence as “green ukraine.”, siberian regionalism or ,  as it is known, has a long history, but in recent years it has faced a new source of opposition. after the fall of the soviet union, russia’s regions enjoyed unprecedented levels of local autonomy, with the federal government either too weak or ineffective to impose its will on their administrations. however, since 2001, putin has embarked upon a ,  to strengthen the vertical power structures leading from places like khabarovsk to the kremlin. his hand-picked governors, like the candidate that furgal defeated in 2018, have been the linchpins of that plan., historically, moscow has used the precarious geography of the far east against those who sought to distance themselves from its power. with china’s eastern borders beginning just across the river from khabarovsk, the threat of expansionism and the need for protection was a compelling argument against going it alone. but now china’s presence in the far east is being felt in an altogether different way. beijing is behind billions of dollars of investment in the region, fueling both the stagnating economy but and ,  with the local population., russian media has repeatedly claimed as fact a narrative that chinese investment has been accompanied by mass chinese migration to the far east, creating fears that the region is within beijing’s sights. the reality that the ,  has done little to assuage those concerns. one internet documentary, “china – a deadly friend,” went viral in 2015 with claims that chinese tanks could roll into central khabarovsk in under 30 minutes. in granting a series of concessions to chinese firms, moscow has itself become a , , with locals fearing their home is being offered up as “a raw materials supplier for the people’s republic of china.”, regional elections in september gave a clear sign that those tensions are coming to the fore. elsewhere in siberia, opposition candidates handed rare defeats to the ruling united russia party, with allies of poisoned opposition politician alexei navalny gaining seats in the central asian cities of tomsk and novosibirsk. while navalny’s blend of ethnic nationalism might have made him an unlikely figure for young russians to unite around, his prominence as a critic of the kremlin made his bloc the de facto choice for a protest vote., while some in russia’s far east do occasionally speak of an independent “united states of siberia,” the idea lacks prominent supporters or any realistic prospect of success. however, the tensions behind it and the growing resistance to being directly governed from another continent will continue to define relations between russia’s center and its extremities. for those in russia’s far east, moscow might seem like a world away – with eight time zones and a five-day train journey dividing them. now though, the distance between the two looks to be growing.][disabling auto-updates may improve reliability when using a screen reader or keyboard to navigate., advertisement, supported by, the hacking group, energetic bear, is among russia’s stealthiest. it appears to be casting a wide net to find useful targets ahead of the election, experts said., by,  , cybersecurity officials watched with growing alarm in september as russian state hackers started prowling around dozens of american state and local government computer systems just two months before the election., the act itself did not worry them so much — officials anticipated that the russians who interfered in the 2016 election would be back — but the actor did. the group, known to researchers as “dragonfly” or “energetic bear” for its hackings of the energy sector, was not involved in 2016 election hacking. but it has in the past five years breached the power grid, water treatment facilities and even nuclear power plants, including , ., it also hacked into wi-fi systems at san francisco international airport and at least two other west coast airports in march in an apparent bid to find one unidentified traveler, a demonstration of the hackers’ power and resolve., september’s intrusions marked the first time that researchers caught the group, a unit of russia’s federal security service, or f.s.b., targeting states and counties. the timing of the attacks so close to the election and the potential for disruption set off concern inside private security firms, law enforcement and intelligence agencies., “one possible explanation is that they are calling in the real pros — the a team — who is used to operating in this really sensitive critical infrastructure where you want to keep quiet until you don’t,” said suzanne spaulding, the former under secretary for cybersecurity and critical infrastructure at the department of homeland security., in 2016, russian hackers from other groups were unusually noisy in their efforts to penetrate some state election databases. “you could argue they didn’t care about being quiet,” ms. spaulding said. but now that russia has been called out and punished for interfering in the election, president vladimir v. putin “may want to keep this quiet until the circumstances are set for their use in information operations,” she added., american officials described the hackings in an advisory on thursday as “opportunistic,” rather than a clear attack on election infrastructure, but conceded the group had targeted dozens of state and local systems and stolen data from at least two targets’ servers., “they’re broadly looking to scan for vulnerabilities and they’re working opportunistically,” said christopher c. krebs, the director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, which issued the warning along with the f.b.i., that hardly reassured researchers who have tracked energetic bear for years. “this appears to be preparatory, to ensure access when they decide they need it,” said adam meyers, the head of threat intelligence at crowdstrike, a security firm that has monitored the group., energetic bear typically casts a wide net, then zeros in on a few high-value targets. in germany and the united states, the group has infected websites popular in the energy sector, downloading malware onto the machines of anyone who visited the sites, then searching for employees with access to industrial systems., in other attacks, it has hijacked the software updates for computers attached to industrial control systems. it has also blasted targets with phishing emails in search of employees, or co-workers, who might have access to critical systems at water, power and nuclear plants., and it has done so with , . a disturbing screenshot in a 2018 ,  showed the groups’ hackers with their fingers on the switches of the computers that controlled the industrial systems at a power plant., the group has thus far stopped short of sabotage, but appears to be preparing for some future attack. the hackings so unnerved officials that starting in 2018, the united states cyber command, the arm of the pentagon that conducts offensive cyberattacks, hit back , ., some called the counterattacks the digital era’s equivalent of mutually assured destruction. but any hope that american officials had that their strikes would deter russia dissipated when the group started targeting american airports in march., officials at san francisco international airport discovered russia’s state hackers had breached the online system that airport employees and travelers used to gain access to the airport’s wi-fi. the hackers injected code into two wi-fi portals that stole visitors’ user names, cracked their passwords and infected their laptops., the attack began on march 17 and continued for nearly two weeks until it was shut down. by then, officials at two other airports discovered their wi-fi portals had also been compromised. researchers would not name the other victims, citing nondisclosure agreements, but said they were on the west coast., as pervasive as the attacks could have been, researchers believe russia’s hackers were interested only in one specific person traveling through the airports that day., “ostensibly, hundreds of thousands of people could have been compromised,” said eric chien, a cybersecurity director at symantec, who examined the attack. “but only 10 were.”, mr. chien’s team discovered that the hackers were “fingerprinting” the machines of anyone who logged onto the wi-fi network in search of one older version of microsoft’s internet explorer browser. if they found a match, the hackers infected those laptops. if the wi-fi visitors used any other browser, the hackers left them alone., “from what we could see, they were going after a specific individual,” mr. chien said., in the government alert on thursday, officials said that the russian group was again targeting aviation systems. it did not name the targets but did suggest in some technical language that one could have been the airport in columbus, ohio., in a previous homeland security warning about the group, officials said it “targets low security and small networks to gain access and move laterally to networks of major, high-value asset owners within the energy sector.”, security researchers warned that the spate of attacks on american state and local systems could mirror the trajectory of those attacks: russia’s hackers using their foothold in seemingly random victims’ networks to mine for more interesting targets closer to the election on nov. 3. they could take steps like pulling offline the databases that verify voters’ signatures on mail-in ballots, or given their particular expertise, shutting power to key precincts., “the most disconcerting piece is that it demonstrates russia’s intent and ability to target systems near and dear to us, but that shouldn’t surprise us,” said frank cilluffo,, the, director of auburn university’s mccrary institute for cyber and critical infrastructure security., by deputizing the f.s.b.’s stealthiest infrastructure hackers to target state and local systems, some security experts believe russia may be hedging its bets., if, for example, mr. putin believes president trump will be re-elected and wants to forge a better relationship with the united states, he may want to limit the degree to which russia is seen as interfering., likewise, the experts said, if former vice president joseph r. biden jr., the democratic nominee, is elected, russia may try to use its foothold in the systems to weaken or delegitimize him, or it may hold back so as not to provoke the new administration., “by doing this more quietly, you give yourself more options,” ms. spaulding said., advertisement][sections, tv, featured, more from nbc,  follow nbc news , washington — intelligence and cybersecurity officials say they see no sign that russian hackers have tried to infiltrate the election infrastructure the way they did in 2016, when all 50 states were probed, and voter rolls in some states were accessed. officials also say that when it comes to cyber defenses, this is , ., but those same officials acknowledge that there is no way to protect every state, county and precinct network from infiltration by hackers, and that the russians or another foreign power could still decide to mount a cyber offensive to disrupt the election., experts say this is unlikely, because it would mean crossing a red line that could provoke a serious reaction from the u.s. government. and they say it would be extremely difficult for hackers to actually change vote tallies., but if an adversary decided to attack, here are the ways experts say the russians (or even less likely, ,  or the chinese) could use cyber techniques to cause an election nightmare:, \"“imagine an infrastructure attack, maybe in some key precincts, or states, swing states for the election, where maybe power goes out, or maybe the 911 service goes out,” frank figliuzzi, the fbi’s former counterintelligence chief and an nbc news contributor, said. “or you cant use your credit card or pump gas. just something that sows discord and confusion.”\", u.s. officials have long said the russians have planted “cyber bombs” on american power grids and communications networks to be triggered at a later date if desired. perhaps the most ruthless and effective way the russians could disrupt the election would be to shut down the power or the cellphone service in a few critical areas, making it impossible to vote., this is perhaps the most frightening scenario but also the least likely, because such an attack could be considered an act of war, and the u.s. might feel compelled to retaliate, not just with a cyberattack, but also a military response., as the recent spate of attacks on hospitals has shown, ransomware is a devastating method of cyberattack that is extremely hard to stop. all it takes is a computer user clicking on a malicious link, thereby opening a network to malware that encrypts all the data and turns computers into bricks, unless a ransom is paid to unlock it., the ransomware attacks against u.s. hospitals are being carried out by a russian-speaking eastern european criminal group, experts say, but nothing prevents the russian government from deploying a similar group — the russian state often works with criminal hackers, u.s. officials say — to attack american elections., a recent ransomware attack against local government systems in hall county, georgia, has slowed the election department’s capacity to count absentee ballots, officials there have said., voting machines themselves aren’t connected to the internet, but ransomware attacks against a county or precinct could shut down critical supporting networks that could make it difficult to conduct the election. in a swing state, the impact could be huge., \"“weve seen an increase in the use of ransomware by folks who maybe couldnt write it themselves, but now its available out on the black market and they can buy it,” said matt drake, a former fbi election threats specialist now with defense contractor saic. “and its certainly concerning that if it were launched shortly before the elections. it could be difficult for some places to overcome that.”\", on primary day in 2016, some voters showed up to the polls in riverside county, california, only to learn that their voter registration information had been changed online — their party affiliation had been switched — and they couldn’t vote in their preferred primary. baffled voters insisted they hadn’t made the changes. the local district attorney concluded the voter rolls had been hacked., and if they had chosen to do so could have tampered on a large enough scale to seriously disrupt the election. they say they haven’t detected russian hacks of voter rolls this cycle, but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been any or won’t be., imagine if the russians or some other adversary deleted every third voter registration record in three pennsylvania counties, and voters showed up, only to be turned away., in knox county tennessee, during a 2018 mayoral primary, officials say a distributed denial of service, or ddos, attack, shut down a county website publishing election results. the county had to mail out the official tallies. the actual vote was not affected, but some members of the public weren’t able to see the results on election night., in a presidential election, the associated press and other news organizations deploy reporters all over the country to eyeball official results and send them in, so it would be difficult for hackers to blind the country to most of the results. large media companies have strategies to defend against ddos attacks., but reporters can’t be everywhere. if these attacks, which are easy to carry out, were deployed against local governments on a large scale around the country, experts say, they could disrupt and delay the dissemination of some election results and undermine confidence in the vote., the most plausible threat from russia and other adversaries this election season is not a physical hack, but a mental one, experts say. the russians (and, to a lesser extent, the chinese and the iranians) are ready to deploy english-language disinformation on social media that is designed to exacerbate any dispute about the vote count, and any protest in the election’s aftermath., these disinformation networks are designed to take a small incident, such as a few mishandled ballots, and amplify it in a way that allows one side or the other to cry fraud. one term for this is “perception hack.” foreign adversaries don’t have to do much, experts say, because extremists on the far left and the far right have shown themselves all too eager to traffic in conspiracy theories that spread like a virus through social media., if the election results are disputed, current and former intelligence officials told nbc news they worry the russians will dust off a playbook they intended to employ if donald trump lost narrowly to hillary clinton in 2016, a drumbeat of disinformation designed to sow doubts about the results., in part for this reason, the fbi and the department of homeland security’s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency have repeatedly warned americans to think twice before passing along unverified information about supposed election irregularities., but in terms of their reach, those warnings can hardly compete with the giant bullhorn commanded by trump, who has repeatedly and without evidence claimed the 2020 election ,  if he loses it., ken dilanian is a correspondent covering intelligence and national security for the nbc news investigative

second russia-africa public forum organized jointly by the world association of foreign alumni of russian universities and african business initiative union., it was held within the framework of russia’s strategy for the development and strengthening of trade, economic, social and cultural relations with the countries of the african continent, as well as building a stronger institutional foundation for russian-african cooperation., since its creation in october 2018, it has become a platform for discussing ways of interaction between russia and african countries on a wide range of issues, with special attention to the development of socio-cultural, humanitarian, trade and economic cooperation., this month, prominent political and public officials, representatives of academic circles, the business community, and student and youth organizations were brought to the forum, which organizers believe provides a platform to exchange views on current issues of developing multifaceted relations between russia and african countries., greeting the participants, foreign minister sergey lavrov reiterated that russian-african cooperation, which is rooted in the period of the joint struggle against colonialism, is based on the principles of equality and mutual respect., “russia’s relations with african countries have always been friendly and multifaceted. however, it is necessary to adjust them to modern realities. we proceed from the assumption that the impetus of the russia-africa summit held in sochi in october 2019 can help us take our interaction to a fundamentally new level,” he stressed with optimism., lavrov said: “i believe that our public and the academic community can do a great deal to help choose methods of boosting russian-african partnership. there is no doubt that the forum will provide a useful platform for developing innovative ideas and proposals in this sphere, and that it will help the russian public learn more and understand better the needs of africa, which is a geographically remote but spiritually close continent.”, the two-day forum focused on\\\\xa0the modernization of education in the context of globalization and the scientific and technological revolutions., it reviewed the strategy of economic cooperation\\\\xa0in modern conditions, the development and implementation of new effective institutions and mechanisms of interaction., it discussed, at length, the problems of international cultural cooperation in the context of modern threats and challenges., it looked at the ever-growing role of public organizations in various aspects of society’s life and the interaction in the field of healthcare as one of the most pressing issues of the russian-african dialogue. there were plenary sessions., plenary session 1: russia – africa: dialogue of civil societies as the main driver of the future world order and sustainable development., plenary session 2: youth of russia and africa: a path towards rapprochement, plenary session 3: graduates of russia as a unique human capital. export of russian education to africa. personnel training: what kind of specialists does the african continent need today?, panel session 4: business and civil society institutions. innovative technologies of russian companies for the benefit of sustainable development of the african continent., panel session 5: africa: pressing health issues. public health and welfare. pandemic shock., speakers and participants have, however, acknowledged the significance of the public forum and stressed that it would be impossible to elevate the entire range of relations between russia and african countries to an entirely new level unless the public at large takes the most energetic part in these efforts., it is hard to overestimate the role of this in strengthening friendship, trust and mutual understanding between the two parties without adequate and consistent exchange of information. it is necessary to maximize the potential of public, cultural and business diplomacy using the basic instrument of the media, according to the chairman of the board of the valdai international discussion club’s development and support foundation andrei bystritsky, speaking at the plenary meeting of the second russia-africa public forum., “on the one hand, the russian public knows little about africa. and i guess people in africa know little about russia,” he noted, and explained that russia and africa need to communicate more. creating necessary conditions for conversation is important, as communication is the foundation of development, and will help strengthen the mutually beneficial ties between russia and africa., as already known, africa is an important partner for russia. this fact was highly re-echoed throughout the forum. speakers and participants explicitly expressed the need to strengthen relations in various fields. further, most of the issues and diverse opinions expressed there have to improve the current level of relationship. russia and africa have to make that mutual desire, in practical terms, to step up cooperation in all areas including social spheres., in this connection, it requires complete understanding, support for new initiatives and, commitment to expand friendly relations with africa. these efforts directed not only at consolidating cooperation with the african countries but also at resolving key african problems such as overcoming social inequality and the involvement of young africans in sustainable economic development., despite the challenges, moscow plans to boost its presence on the continent in the coming years and, as outlined in the russia-africa summit declaration, both russia and africa have to begin pursuing targeted goals, continue encouraging exchanges between russia and african countries., russia readies to host xii brics summit, \"md africa editor\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nkester kenn klomegah is an independent

consequences of\\\\xa0the covid-19\\\\xa0pandemic., in addition, the leaders will focus on significant and complicated issues or questions relating to geopolitical to socioeconomic spheres, transformations on the global landscapes in the 21st century. the meeting will adopt a working document that will further reinforce the position and development of the group., as stipulated by the guidelines, russia took over the rotating presidency of the brics from brazil. since its establishment, brics has come a long way from an informal venue for exchanging views on current issues on the international agenda to an absolutely mature and stable network of\\\\xa0multilateral interaction on diverse issues on international and domestic agenda of the five brics countries., now brics has a multilateral structure, and become an association pushing for fair, democratic and multipolar world order. russia has agreed to strengthen and promote strategic partnership in all key areas of brics activities, such as politics and security, the economy and finance, educational and cultural ties., the theme of the meeting of the leaders of brics is “brics partnership for global stability, shared security and innovative growth.” they will discuss the enhancement of\\\\xa0their countries’ trade and economic collaboration and coordination at international stage or platforms., it plans to end its chairmanship with a strong set of new agreements, including the already agreed upon brics anti-terrorism strategy and the updated strategy for economic partnership to 2025. this\\\\xa0document defines guidelines and\\\\xa0priorities of\\\\xa0cooperation and\\\\xa0gives a\\\\xa0new impetus to\\\\xa0development of\\\\xa0trade and\\\\xa0investment cooperation among the\\\\xa0five countries., it further provides a number of initiatives to strengthen sector-specific cooperation among the members. the people-to-people and cultural ties, as well as contacts between experts and civil society representatives are already expanding., despite the current global situation due to the spread of the coronavirus infection, the activities under the russian brics chairmanship in 2020 have been carried out in a consistent manner. since january 2020, a number of events have already been organized, including via videoconferencing., russia’s foreign minister sergei lavrov has reiterated that deepening the strategic partnership in brics is one of russia’s foreign policy priorities., over the past decade, the group has proved to be a relevant and well-respected format of cooperation. the brics countries maintain solidarity in strengthening collective principles in global affairs; they advocate respect for the sovereignty and sovereign equality of all states, and are deeply convinced that any conflicts should be resolved by peaceful means only., the group collectively defends the principles of a more just world order based on respect for the norms and principles of international law and the united nations charter., according to procedure, each brics member takes over the chairmanship for a year. russia last chaired brics in 2015, held a summit in the provincial city of ufa. russia also presided over the group back in 2009, before bric turned into brics following south africa’s accession. the five brics countries together represent over 3.1 billion people, or about 40 percent of the world population., published, on, by, on october 3, 2000, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and president vladimir putin cemented india-russia bilateral ties with the signing of the historical agreement, the “, .” two decades since the signing of the agreement, bilateral relations are hailed to have chartered new levels of cooperation amid fast changing regional and global scenarios. while shouldering mutual interests and concerns, the strategic partnership has been at the cusp of litmus test, as it has endured events such as the 9/11 terrorist attack, colour revolutions, the georgian war, the economic depression in 2008, the 26/11 mumbai attack, the crimean referendum and its aftermath and the current covid-19 pandemic. it is therefore worth reflecting on the two decades of a seemingly positive bilateral engagement between india and russia. it is important to analyse how the agreement signed in 2000 has played a role in the continuum of ensuring the mutual understanding, peaceful cooperation and reliability between the two strategic partners. this is also an opportunity to critically evaluate the magnitude of our strategic relationship and the changes in the foreign policy priorities since 2000. given the current global context, the key question is how prepared are india and russia for insulating the strategic partnership amid the challenges in the post pandemic world?, the declaration of strategic partnership (2000) was signed at a time when the momentum in the bilateral relations between india and russia post-soviet collapse had fatigued due to several factors. but the most crucial factor of them all was the renewal of the , . the renewed 1993 treaty had almost written off the bilateral engagement, as russia clarified that it was no longer willing to make any defence commitment during the time of any external military threat to india – a key security clause (article ix) that constituted the very core of the 1971 indo-soviet treaty., the strategic partnership treaty signed in 2000 gave a new lease of life as it restored india-russia relations to respectable levels.both the countries realised the need to develop a multifaceted bilateral cooperation in all possible spheres of defence, energy, space, nuclear, science and technology etc. india’s strategic partnership with russia since then has been unique, intense and substantive in many ways. mainly, the treaty led to the institutionalization of high level political interactions through annual bilateral summits – a key feature of the agreement to foster extensive collaboration and dynamism in the partnership. the twenty annual bilateral summits held so far between india and russia have in particular seen major agreements and initiatives undertaken to strengthen the partnership to higher levels., additionally, in 2010, the bilateral ties were further elevated with the signing of the “, .” arguably, the partnership between the two countries has been successfully reflected in many instances at regional and global platforms. ,  general assembly referendum against russia for its accession of crimea in 2014 and russia’s unequivocal support to india on the kashmir issue are few cases in point., regarding strategic partnership in sensitive spheres of cooperation between india and russia, defence cooperation continues to be one of the major boosters for engagement between the two countries. india has acknowledged russia’s contribution in assisting the former in military power projection and preserving its national security interests. although in recent times there is downgrading in the purchase of russian defence equipment by india, the cooperation in this sphere has been unassailable given that it has progressed from buyer-seller relations to joint research development and production, high-end technology transfer that has encouraged india’s quest for indigenous defence capabilities. from the induction of ins vikramaditya to the joint production of brahmos missile, india-russia defence cooperation has achieved new capacities through acquisitions and joint development. in fact, russia’s resurgence as a military power in recent times is conducive to india’s domestic initiatives such as the make in india project. the finalising of the ,  despite the threat of imposition of caatsa sanctions has shown india’s predictable resistance to external pressures given its historical ties with russia., indo-russian nuclear cooperation constitutes an important element of our strategic partnership. the kudankulam nuclear power plant (knpp) has become one of the biggest success stories of india-russia cooperation. as unit 1 and unit 2 start commercial operation, the process for reactor buildings of units 3 and 4 have already begun. with the construction of 12 nuclear power plants planned, india-russia nuclear cooperation has indeed reached new heights. india, russia and bangladesh signed a trilateral agreement in march 2018, for the construction of a npp in rooppur, bangladesh.,  has been another major element of the strategic partnership, since russia, an export-oriented energy country, will aim to leverage its energy card with india, an import-oriented energy market. india’s interests in the arctic, for instance, especially energy resources, are a crucial aspect for india’s growing energy security needs. , . this is seen as a great step towards strengthening india-russia energy cooperation., the bilateral partnership, which has a global strategic connotation, has seen both the countries enthusiastically promote the idea of building a multipolar world order and changing the global financial structure. in this regard, both india and russia have envisaged promoting a harmonious global order based on international law and collective decision-making that includes developing countries and is not monopolised by developed countries alone. india and russia, along with other players such as china, have succeeded in establishing non-western organisations such as brics and sco. the member states have, within their capabilities and limitations, established mechanisms that address economic and strategic interests, such as the new development bank. while brics and sco have become tools of political signalling on issues related to global affairs, there however exist asymmetries among the member states with regard to economic growth performance, distribution of resources and military strength. additionally, although china is a member of such multilateral organisations, at the individual level beijing has exercised assertive posturing that has caused concern in india. this can be seen by its irrational border claims and actions in the indian ocean region. the role of russia especially during the time of crisis between india and china is therefore anticipated to be non-partisan and meaningful., when the treaty of strategic partnership was signed in 2000, the world was at the brink of a war on terrorism after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade centre. both india and russia, at their respective level, joined the bandwagon on the global war on terror. both parties, as bilateral partners which have been victims of terrorist attacks, voiced their interests and concerns in combating terrorism and related activities. india and russia have therefore cooperated at bilateral and multilateral levels. for instance, , . india and russia also share the mutual interest of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their possible acquisition by terrorist groups., while both india and russia assert their distinctive identity in world politics respectively, the strategic partnership has seen close coordination of foreign policy interests to a wide range of international and regional issues. both countries firmly believe that intensification of the indo-russian strategic partnership can help respond to the challenges thrown up by global changes in a more effective way. while both india and russia have a diverging approach on the indo-pacific narrative, one cannot deny that the two countries understand the need for ,  in accordance with the universally accepted principles of international law. this includes combating piracy at sea and providing humanitarian aid during natural disasters. the two countries have shown keen interest in restoring peace and stability in afghanistan. eurasian integration has been a key priority in the india-russia strategic partnership. russia understands that in its quest for “greater eurasia,” india is a vital player for its huge market potential, economic growth performance, military strength and enhanced position in international affairs., strategic partnership in ,  between india and russia since the soviet era and has continued to remain one even today. in fact, both countries have agreed to expand their relations in the aerospace sphere, an area of traditional cooperation for decades. more than 500 joint projects involving scientists and research institutes from both countries have been undertaken within the framework of various initiatives since 2000., while critically evaluating the two decades of strategic partnership between india and russia, it is tempting to compare india’s strategic partnership with other major global players and the strategic partnership that it shares with russia. the new realities of the dynamic nature of international relations have definitely posed a challenge to the partnership. the pursuing of an all-alignment foreign policy has caused a certain level of discomfort in the bilateral relations. india’s growing proximity with the u.s. and russia’s compromised defence cooperation with china and mending of ties with pakistan in recent times has caused anxiety in the strategic partnership between india and russia. one possible inference that one can draw is the constant comparison to the current india-russia partnership with that of the nostalgia of indo-soviet ties. but one needs to bear in mind that compared to the strategic partnership that both india and russia share with other major players, there are limitations and shrouded with lack of trust. india’s defence relations with u.s., for instance, is yet to make any substantive development in joint production and restrictiveness about its technology compared to russia’s generosity to sharing defence technology and russia’s relations with pakistan is eclipsed with lack of trust and understanding. as for russia-china relations, there is growing speculation of a possible role reversal in the partnership given china’s growth in global politics in recent times., however, there are few stumbling blocks in india-russia defence cooperation, especially the shifting trends in partnership, for example defence engagement between russia and china. russia’s current cooperation with china has emerged exclusively, as it includes cooperation in sensitive fields, such as strategic missile defence, hypersonic technology, and the construction of nuclear submarines. with , , allowing for the latter to be well equipped with similar and more advanced capabilities, china is a major security concern for india. hence, given the way , , collaboration in advanced future weapon systems, including quantum technology and artificial intelligence, should be enhanced further between india and russia., indo-russian relations are undoubtedly at the cusp of a litmus test. nonetheless, the strategic partnership should see the future of asia beyond the u.s. and china factors, and both india and russia can play a decisive role in promoting their mutual interests in the region., the rapid and uncontrollable spread of covid-19 in the past seven months has impacted the global order and the interconnected systems. reflecting the spirit of the partnership in times of crisis, , . russia also welcomed india’s goodwill gesture to send medical supplies to help fight the virus., critics have often pointed out that the strategic partnership is yet to achieve its full potential, given the fact that some of the spheres of cooperation continue to be remain obsolete, for instance, the economic relations. additionally, given nearly 70 years of diplomatic relations, soft power capabilities, cultural diplomacy, academic exchange programmes, and labour migration are at an imperceptible status., trade and investment remains the weakest link in our strategic partnership and falls far short of our potential, which unfortunately is not commensurate with our high-level political cooperation. post the announcement of the strategic agreement in 2000, which largely promotes the strengthening of economic relations between india and russia, the trade cart received much required upgrade. potential areas of trade have been explored, which include trade and investment, energy, nuclear, science and technology, pharmaceuticals, it, steel, diamonds, fertilizers, infrastructure, heavy engineering and food products. exploring economic prosperity, sustainable development, and free movement of people, information, knowledge, ideas and greater institutional links has also become crucial., in fact, both countries have set a target of ,  in each other’s country by the year 2025. it is also heartening that new options are being explored to further expand the domain of economic cooperation, eurasian integrity, regional cooperation, free trade agreements, connectivity and trade corridors have gained the utmost importance in the annual bilateral summits in the past two decades. the two countries have also set up mechanisms such as intergovernmental commissions. for example, ,  (irigc-tec), the international north south transport corridor and the eurasian economic union, which have emerged as immediate priority areas for strong economic cooperation between the two countries., the russian far-east is another region for potential economic engagement. india’s presence in the eastern economic forum (eef) is aimed at developing trade, commerce, investment, railway infrastructure, steel plants, defence, space, ports and shipping. india has successfully participated in the annual eef, with prime minister ,  for the development of the far east. other than these developments, our economic ties are focused on exploring the potential of sub-regional cooperation. sub-regional cooperation has emerged as one of the prospective areas of cooperation and regional connectivity to add further impetus to the economic cooperation between india and russia. the key goal is to cement and institutionalise cooperation between the states and union territories of the republic of india and provinces of the russian federation., to further bolster india’s far ambitions, an ,  of four indian states led by the commerce and industry minister of india piyush goyal visited vladivostok to explore the opportunities and potential of business to business (b2b) cooperation in the far. with the introduction of the ,  in the world, the need for both india and russia to tap the potentials of agricultural sector is crucial. regional connectivity needs due attention, hence the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors, such as chennai-vladivostok, needs prompt engagement., the major impact of the pandemic has prompted countries to explore alternate market destinations and shifts in the business environment. the crisis has opened opportunities for countries such as india and russia to reposition themselves in the global supply chain. russia, with its efforts to attract investment to the far east, and india, with its huge manpower and existing available manufacturing units, should be endorsed as potential and suitable alternatives for manufacturing, instead of developed nations., despite the seemingly successful bilateral relations between india and russia, the strategic community is incomplete if there is shortfall in establishing strong people-to-people engagement. since the soviet collapse, bilateral relations have seen minimal cultural diplomacy, academic exchange and labour migration. perhaps new vistas of cooperation could be explored to promote soft power capabilities between the two countries, such as cinema, which has always been one of the most successful foreign policy tools to enhance cultural exchange and people-to-people contact between countries., the film industry is a great medium for spreading narratives, and in india movies have an immense following as well as impact on the minds of the population. india and russia collaborated in movie production during the soviet era, however, the trend did not last long due to the fall of the soviet union, among other factors. the time is right for both india and russia to collaborate in the entertainment industry, especially through joint production of movies and creating powerful narratives related to bilateral cooperation. india and russia must concentrate more on the content of the movie rather than joint production alone, as for the audience the content matters more than the producer. moreover, it can have an everlasting impact on the minds of the indian population if the content projects a russian character aiding/collaborating with an indian protagonist in a movie in bringing down an antagonist. also, the indian movie industry is always on the look for exotic locations in foreign lands. hence, in order to attract the indian movie industry, russia could look into easing travel and other shooting permissions within its jurisdictions. such an effort would not only bring closer industry ties, but also be able to showcase the russia and its rich culture to the indian population, thereby acting as a window of promotion for russian tourism., regarding geopolitical realignment, today the global community is seeking pragmatic internationalism. the role of india and russia is crucial in their efforts to diffuse the multipolar world system. this is also relevant for regional alliances to actively engage politically and economically, which should help bilateral relations between the two countries elevate to a higher pedestal in post-pandemic world order., the current global situation has given rise to some daunting challenges for the partnership once again. some of the ,  are linked to the disruptions being caused to the international order by traditional and non-traditional threats such as climate change, , , secure communication challenges etc. nurturing hopes for stability and prosperity in eurasia in the post pandemic world, bilateral relations between india and russia and their proactive role in regional mechanisms such as sco, eurasian economic union (eaeu), and russia-india-china (ric) are viewed as an integral part of this construct. regional connectivity needs due attention including the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors., in conclusion, the signing of the milestone agreement in 2000 was the outcome of developments that took place in bilateral relations between india and russia after the fall of the soviet union. the main aim of the agreement was to elevate the partnership to new level of cooperation and put speculations and uncertainties in the relationship to rest. over the past twenty years of relations, the partnership has seen many ups and downs. nonetheless, this has not allowed any major damage that could impact or lead to any serious conflict of interest between the two countries. having said that, the coveted relations built over the years cannot be taken for granted. in this regard, apart from political elites and bureaucrats playing a crucial role in enhancing the relations, academicians, artists, students, the research community, think tanks and educational institutions should contribute to forming the true essence of the partnership. the youth, in particular, need to draw inspiration from each other’s rich history and cultural relevance, carrying forward the vision for a long-term partnership. the engagement of both countries in the international ecosystem in the post pandemic world has become even more relevant, as it has given rise to new challenges and opportunities. the strategic partnership between india and russia nevertheless needs to insulate the mutual interests from challenges that emerge from within and from external factors. perhaps, the need for a reality check and serious introspection will be crucial as the challenges are only set to grow given the dynamism of international relations., from our partner , published, on, by, despite its large population of 1.5 billion which many have considered as an impediment, china’s domestic economic reforms and collaborative strategic diplomacy with external countries have made it attain superpower status over the united states. while united states influence is rapidly fading away, china has indeed taken up both the challenges and unique opportunities to strengthen, especially its economic muscles., on october 22, vladimir putin took part, via videoconference, in\\\\xa0the\\\\xa0final plenary session of\\\\xa0the\\\\xa017,  annual meeting of\\\\xa0the\\\\xa0valdai international discussion club. the valdai discussion club was established in 2004, with a goal is to promote dialogue between russian and international intellectual elite, and to make an independent, unbiased scientific analysis of political, economic and social events in russia and the rest of the world., putin\\\\xa0touched on\\\\xa0a\\\\xa0wide range of\\\\xa0different issues. what particularly interesting was his assessment of the changing politics and the economy, and rating of the global superpower. “the\\\\xa0world has changed several times. meanwhile, time increasingly and\\\\xa0insistently makes us question what lies ahead for\\\\xa0humanity,” he said during his interactive speech with the participants., in\\\\xa0effect, the\\\\xa0post-war world order was established by\\\\xa0three victorious countries: the\\\\xa0soviet union, the\\\\xa0united states and\\\\xa0great britain. the\\\\xa0role of\\\\xa0britain has changed since then; the\\\\xa0soviet union no longer exists, while some try to\\\\xa0dismiss russia altogether, according to putin., indeed, the\\\\xa0soviet union is no longer there. but there is russia. in\\\\xa0terms of\\\\xa0its economic weight and\\\\xa0political influence, china is moving quickly towards superpower status. germany is moving in\\\\xa0the\\\\xa0same direction, and\\\\xa0the\\\\xa0federal republic of\\\\xa0germany has become an\\\\xa0important player in\\\\xa0international cooperation. at\\\\xa0the\\\\xa0same time, the\\\\xa0roles of\\\\xa0great britain and\\\\xa0france in\\\\xa0international affairs has undergone significant changes, he further explained., the\\\\xa0united states, which at\\\\xa0some point absolutely dominated the\\\\xa0international stage, can hardly claim exceptionality any longer. generally speaking, does the\\\\xa0united states need this exceptionalism? he asked rhetorically, and further cited that powerhouses such as\\\\xa0brazil, south africa and\\\\xa0some other countries have become much more influential in the world., amid the\\\\xa0current fragmentation of\\\\xa0international affairs, there are challenges that require more than just the\\\\xa0combined capacity of\\\\xa0a\\\\xa0few states, even very influential ones. problems of\\\\xa0this magnitude, which do exist, require global attention. international stability, security, fighting terrorism and\\\\xa0solving urgent regional conflicts are certainly among them; as\\\\xa0are promoting global economic development, combating poverty, and\\\\xa0expanding cooperation in\\\\xa0healthcare. that last one is especially relevant today., arguably, china has worked on all that is now recorded as its grandiose achievements. it has systematically transformed its economy at the same time, maintained the political structure. its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions. it brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history. china reduced extreme poverty by 800 million., as expected of any development process, there are still problems. nonetheless, the level of public support for the government and its management of the country is high, with 80 – 95% of chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a 2019 survey., that compared with russia, putin explained that russia has to begin from the scratch. lenin spoke about the\\\\xa0birthmarks of\\\\xa0capitalism, he reminded, and added that “it cannot be said that we have lived these past 30 years in\\\\xa0a\\\\xa0full-fledged market economy. in\\\\xa0fact, we are only gradually building it, and\\\\xa0its institutions. russia had to\\\\xa0do it from the\\\\xa0ground up, starting from a\\\\xa0clean slate. of\\\\xa0course, we are doing this, taking into consideration, developments around the\\\\xa0world. after all, after almost one hundred years of\\\\xa0a\\\\xa0state-planned economy, transitioning to\\\\xa0a\\\\xa0market economy is not easy.”, on\\\\xa0other way round, it is necessary to\\\\xa0take a\\\\xa0closer look at, in fact a complete insight into the approach, economic capability and\\\\xa0the\\\\xa0services by the chinese. china has such a\\\\xa0diverse landscape, with investment and trade around the world. according to the world bank, china has the largest economy and one of the world’s foremost infrastructural giants. china is the world’s ,  and ,  of goods., china holds 17.7% of the world’s total wealth, the second largest share held by any country. it has the world’s largest banking sector, with assets of $40 trillion and the world’s top 4 largest banks all being in china. in 2019, china overtook the us as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world, according to the global wealth report by credit suisse. it has the highest number of rich people in the world’s top 10% of wealth since 2019. there were 658 chinese billionaires and 3.5 million millionaires., china’s belt and road initiative has expanded significantly over the last six years and, as of april 2020, includes 138 countries and 30 international organization. along with brazil, russia, india and south africa, china is a member of the brics group of emerging major economies., in recent years, the country has significantly strengthened bilateral ties with asian countries such as china and india, with latin american countries. an important aspect of russia’s relations with the west is the criticism of russia’s political system and over human rights. on the other hand, putin’s leadership over the return of order, stability, and progress has won him widespread admiration., after the united states, the european union and other countries imposed economic sanctions after the annexation of crimea and a collapse in oil prices, the proportion of middle-class could decrease drastically., the population moves forth and back, russia has to support its economy with increasing population. since 2006, the russian government started simplifying immigration laws and launched a state program for providing assistance to voluntary immigration of ethnic russians from former soviet republics. in one of his previous speeches, putin declared that russia’s population could reach 146 million by 2025, mainly as a result of immigration., sprawling from the baltic sea to the pacific ocean, russia has more than a fifth of the world’s forests, which makes it the largest forest country in the world. with it’s extensive mineral and energy resources, russia is a major great power and has the potential to become a superpower. russia can regain part of its soviet era economic power and political

summit in 2017 in hamburg, germany., \"early this month, president trumps national security adviser robert obrien held \",  with his russian counterpart, nikolai patrushev. the two men met in neutral switzerland as patrushev, a confidant of russian president vladimir putin, is under sanctions by ,  and , ., \"one of the reasons i went to meet with gen. patrushev is to let him know that there would be absolutely no tolerance for any interference with our election day,\" , . he said he \"demanded that russia not engage in that sort of thing. the russians have committed to doing so.\", \"despite patrushevs commitment and obriens apparent acceptance of it, u.s. intelligence agencies say russia is still trying to interfere.\", last month, fbi director christopher wray ,  before congress that russia is engaging in \"malign foreign influence\" — including the use of social media and propaganda — that primarily goes after trump\\\\s democratic challenger, joe biden., \"\\\\n vice president joe biden shakes hands with vladimir putin, then russias prime minister, in moscow in 2011.\\\\n \\\\n \", \\\\n , \\\\n , \"vice president joe biden shakes hands with vladimir putin, then russias prime minister, in moscow in 2011.\", the kremlin has categorically denied interfering in any u.s. elections, past or present. but the kremlin also recognizes that the issue has become an obstacle to improving bilateral relations, even slightly., \"a little more than a week after wrays testimony, \", \" an agreement that would ban interference in the other countrys electoral processes. the initiative echoed putins proposal to form \", which he floated during his 2018 summit with trump in finland — and went nowhere., the kremlin is sticking to the line that it is in fact the united states that tries to interfere in russian politics. three years ago, the federation council, the upper house of the parliament, formed a temporary commission on foreign interference in russia., \"it\\\\s called \\\\temporary\\\\ because we hope that the time will come when you won\\\\t interfere with us,\" andrei klimov, the commission\\\\s chairman, tells npr. \"if we make the commission permanent, it would mean you\\\\re going to constantly interfere with us. we still want to believe in the good.\", klimov says his commission has accumulated thousands of pages of documentation of u.s. influence efforts. he claims american foundations connected to the u.s. government work with russian political activists, and that cyberattacks on russia originating in the united states are manyfold those in the other direction., the notion of \"russian interference\" was a bogeyman, he says, invented during the obama administration to try to help hillary clinton win the white house in 2016., \"in moscow, the acrimony left over from the last u.s. presidential election is real. everything was supposed to be so different when donald trump unexpectedly took over the presidency from barack obama, promising to improve relations with russia. what followed instead were continuing charges of russian malfeasance by trumps own intelligence officials — and bipartisan support in congress for tightening sanctions.\", \"now, with about three months left in trumps term, u.s.-russian relations are even more fraught than when he came into office. the last major arms control treaty between the united states and russia will expire in february, and negotiations continue to extend it.\", \"on russian state televisions \", \", a barometer of the kremlins mood, anchor dmitry kiselyov used the first presidential debate to criticize america as a whole.\", anyone who watched the contentious debate was left with a \"feeling of disgust,\" kiselyov said., \"for decades, america has imposed its way of life on the world as a universal model,\" he said. \"and now everything has changed so fast.\", trump, once celebrated as a friend of russia, is no longer seen so favorably. according to , , only 23% of russians have a positive view of trump, while 43% have a negative one. and 55% of respondents said they were hearing about biden for the very first time., the kremlin, of course, knows biden very well., \"i think the very fact that biden was obama\\\\s vice president already makes him not a friendly figure in russia,\" says moscow-based political analyst masha lipman., \"obama looked down on russia. in some of his statements, he certainly sounded not respectful. this caused this sense of offense on russia\\\\s part.\", even as the obama administration pursued a \"reset\" in relations with the kremlin, biden made , , saying in 2009 that it had \"a withering economy\" and was \"clinging to something in the past that was not sustainable.\", on a visit to moscow in 2011, ,  — the russian president is now in his fourth term and looking ahead to two more., : \"i\\\\m looking into your eyes, and i don\\\\t think you have a soul\" — to which putin, in biden\\\\s rendering, smiled and replied: \"we understand one another.\", \"three years later, when russian troops seized ukrainian territory, biden became obamas point man on ukraine.\", still, putin knows biden could become the next american president. asked by a russian tv reporter last week about his preferences, putin tried to be diplomatic., \"we will work with any future president of the united states, with the person who will have the trust of the american people,\" he said., \"we know that president trump has repeatedly spoken in favor of developing russian-american relations. we certainly appreciate that very much,\" he said. he blamed a \"bipartisan consensus on the necessity of containing russia\" for limiting trump\\\\s room for maneuver., at the same time, putin criticized the trump administration for signing off on new sanctions and for withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty last year., as for biden, putin said the democratic candidate used \"sharp anti-russian rhetoric,\" but that the kremlin was encouraged by biden\\\\s interest in preserving the new start arms control treaty — originally negotiated by the obama administration— that expires in february., lipman cautions that the prospects for better relations are bleak no matter who wins. if biden becomes president, he may consolidate european allies against moscow, she says, while if trump is reelected, his political opponents may pursue an even harsher policy toward russia., the only thing that helps the kremlin, lipman says, is more polarization and turmoil in the united states., \"turmoil means the united states weakened,\" she says. \"this is what the kremlin can actually benefit from, not an improvement in relations. this is the only thing that russia may hope for.\", npr thanks our sponsors][watch cbsn live, \\\\n , \\\\n , \\\\n / cbs news\\\\n , in this episode of\\\\xa0, \", host michael morell interviews general h.r. mcmaster. a senior fellow at both stanford universitys hoover institution and its graduate school of business. a career u.s. army officer and national security adviser to president trump, he is also the author of his newly released book titled battlegrounds: the fight to defend the free world. general mcmaster passes along advice on how the next president should handle relations with north koreas kim jong-un, gives his insights on the effectiveness of our handling of russia, and shares his passion for helping those in venezuela.\\\\xa0\", michael morrell: general mcmaster, welcome to intelligence matters. it is an honor to have you on the show.\\\\xa0, \"gen. mcmaster: hey michael, the honors mine is great to be with you.\\\\xa0\", michael morrell: let me start with a couple of points for our listeners. first, i want to congratulate you on your new book, , \" ive read it. its terrific. i think its a must read for anyone interested in national security. and i actually see it as a reference book for understanding the key issues. and i see myself pulling it down off the shelf from time to time. when im thinking about something, i want to have to talk about something, when im writing something. i think its a very important contribution to the literature on the threats and challenges we face as a nation. so thank you. thank you very much for writing it.\", gen. mcmaster: well, michael, thanks so much. i mean it, somebody with your background, experience and knowledge to to endorse it like that. that means a lot to me that you judge it to have been worthwhile. thank you., \"michael morrell: second, having you with us to talk about your book is a perfect way for us to kick off what is for us,\\\\xa0 going to be a new series on the key national security issues facing the united states. the series, which were going to work very hard to be nonpartisan, will run between the \", \" and the inauguration. and finally, i should mention to my listeners that this episode is going to run the day after the election, but that you and i are taping it the friday before the election. so you and i have no idea whats going to happen on election day. so people should just know that as theyre as theyre listening to our conversation. and i think thats actually a good thing for our conversation, because what i want to do at the end of the day is get your sense of what is going to face the president who is sworn in on january 20th, no matter who that person happens to be.\", \"michael morrell: h.r. before we get to the individual issues that i want to walk through with you, id love to ask you why you decided to write the book that you did. you obviously could have written a very different kind of book. and im sure that there were publishers who were encouraging you to do that. but you chose not to do that. you chose to write a very serious look at the threats and challenges that face us as a nation. why did you take the route that you did?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, michael, thank you. i served in the army for thirty four years. so as i transitioned to what is my only second career in my adult life, i made out probably quite predictably, a mission statement for myself. and that was in my second career to try to deepen our understanding of the most crucial challenges we face as a way to better inform the american people about foreign policy and national security issues, and with the hope that if we learn more about these challenges that we face, we can demand better. demand a better foreign policy from our elected leaders. but then also, i hope that the book and the work that im doing around the book will help bring americans back together. right. because i dont think any of these issues should be partisan in nature. what im hoping for is that a deeper understanding of these challenges we face. and i think what should be our common commitment to try to build a better future for generations to come will help bring our country back together, at least around foreign policy and national security issues.\", michael morrell: h.r., what are the main themes of the book? what do you want readers to walk away remembering?, \"gen. mcmaster: well, what are the themes that runs through the book is this idea of strategic narcissism. i think this is one of the reasons why our competence, our ability to compete, at least in the post-cold war period, has been significantly diminished. and by strategic narcissism, i mean, our tendency to define the world only in relation to us and then to assume that what we decide to do or decide not to do is decisive to achieving a favorable outcome. and of course, you know, michael, with your long experience with intelligence, this is flawed because its self-referential and it doesnt acknowledge, you know, the degree to which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future. so the book is then an argument, an argument for cultivating with my friend and great historian zachary shore has termed strategic empathy. and this is an effort, an effort to understand better what drives and constrains the other. especially adversaries, rivals and enemies and what drives and constrains the other often times is ideology and emotion and aspirations. so the theme in the book that also is important is an effort to understand how the recent past produced the present as the first step in making a projection into the future. so the book is an argument for the understanding of history and appreciation for the complex causality of events and a focus on understanding these crucial challenges were facing from the perspective from the perspective of others.\", \"michael morrell: you know, thats one of the thats one of the main jobs of the intelligence community. right? is to is to give our decision makers the point of view of the other guy. the guy sitting across the table from you, the guy sitting across the battlefield from you. but whats the other guy thinking? what are his constraints? what are his interests? and thats extraordinarily important. right?\", \"gen. mcmaster:\\\\xa0 of course, its not a new idea. it goes back to sun tzu, but i think its we started to neglect the importance of this, especially in the post-cold war period, a period that i describe as a period of over optimism. over optimism that led to complacency and a bit of hubris. and this over optimism was in large measure a set up, i think a set of for significant disappointments in the two thousands disappointments, of course, associated with the mass murder attacks of september 11th, 2001, but also the unanticipated length and difficulty of wars in afghanistan and in iraq and, of course, followed by a financial crisis. and so i think it was in the two thousands that this emotional impetus behind our foreign policy shifted from overoptimism to pessimism and from maybe a tendency to under appreciate the risks and costs of action, to a tendency to underappreciate the risks and costs of inaction. and i think that strategic narcissism is the cause, really, in both cases.\", michael morrell: you know, the other thing that strikes me when you talk about the importance of history is i always thought sitting in deputies meetings that it would have been incredibly valuable to actually take a few minutes and every deputies meetings or principals meetings to talk about the history of the issue, just to review how you got from point a to point b, and we never did that in multiple administrations in which i served, but i always thought that that would have been really valuable., \"gen. mcmaster: \\\\xa0well, michael, youre absolutely right about that. ill tell you, one of the one of the great gifts i had, i think before earlier my career was the opportunity to read things, study and write history. and the first book i wrote was \", , which is a story about how and why vietnam became an american war.\\\\xa0, \"and one of the lessons i learned from the study of that history was that it was important to understand problems and challenges holistically before leaping into action. when i came in as national security adviser, i did my best to at least avoid making the same mistakes and we put in place a principle small group framing session. i know thats a mouthful, but as we developed these strategies for the most crucial challenges we were facing, we began with this framing session that was organized around a five page paper that included only really the description of the challenge. how we got to where we are, a bit of the history of it, and then an inventory of our vital interests that were at stake, view of that challenge through the lens of those vital interests and draft overarching goals and more specific objectives, followed by assumptions.\\\\xa0\", \"assumptions about the degree to which we and like-minded partners have agency or influence over this challenge. then an inventory of obstacles to progress and opportunities that we could exploit. and thats it. then we had a discussion about the nature of the challenge. first, the policy coordinating committee, which, you know, are the real workers who are going to work on this project. theyre listening in. so theyre getting, theyre hearing at the cabinet level, a discussion about the nature of the problem and then a refinement of it. once that part of the meeting was done, then we shifted to a discussion of what are your ideas? how do we integrate the elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to overcome these obstacles and exploit these opportunities? then they got to hear the treasury secretary say what we have. we have economic and financial tools available. but those ought to be combined with diplomacy and maybe law enforcement efforts. and then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with. so i think that, i hope thats a process that will be sustained. i dont think my successor hung onto it. it will have to be resurrected at some point if it is deemed as useful by a future national security adviser.\", \"michael morrell: im michael morrell today, we have with us h.r. mcmaster, a senior fellow at both stanford universitys hoover institution and its graduate school of business. a career u.s. army officer and national security adviser to president trump. ok, so what id love to do is go through the individual issues. and what id like to do is just throw one out, get you to frame it. whats the threat or challenge that we face? whats the history? how did we get here? whats our interest thats at stake? and how do you think we as a nation need to go about dealing with it? lets start with the big one. lets start with the big enchilada, china.\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think china is a great example of strategic narcissism at work, and especially this assumption that we clung to for too long, that china, having been welcomed into the international order, would play by the rules, would liberalize its economy, and as it prospered, it would liberalize its form of government. of course, thats not true. thats not true because we undervalue the degree to which emotions and ideology drive and constrain the chinese communist party. and what i would argue in battlegrounds is that the party is driven mainly by fear, fear of losing its exclusive grip on power and an associated ambition. the ambition to achieve national rejuvenation for china to take center stage in the world again after the tragedy, as they portrayed as the century of humiliation. it is that combination of fear and aspiration that is driving the partys effort to extend and tighten its exclusive grip on power internally.\", \"this is why there are over a million people in concentration camps in xinjiang and theres a campaign of cultural genocide ongoing.\\\\xa0\", \"this is why the party is extending their repressive arm to hong kong and perfecting their technologically enabled orwellian surveillance police state. this is what were seeing and then what is even more troubling, i think, is the parties now effort to export its authoritarian mercantilist model.\\\\xa0\", \"through a number of strategies that aim to create servile relationships with countries and then ultimately through economic means, as well as the growth in the peoples liberation armys capabilities to establish areas of privacy across the new pacific region that exclude the united states and then it challenged the united states in the free world globally. if china succeeds, i mean, our world will be less free, less prosperous and less safe. so the stakes are high and its past time for us to recognize the need to compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form of aggression that the parties engaged in.\", michael morrell: what would an effective china strategy look like to you?, \"gen. mcmaster: well, i think the trump administration, if it gets credit for anything, should get credit for a fundamental shift in our policy toward china. one that was long overdue and one that i think is fundamentally sound and this is the idea that we have to compete. and it was under the strategy of of cooperation and engagement that the chinese communist party was emboldened. competition doesnt need to lead to confrontation. in fact, quite the opposite. and i think we have returned to arenas of competition involving countering more effectively chinas campaign of sustained industrial espionage against us, countering a range of chinas unfair trade and economic practices, doing so in large measure through effective international cooperation, for example, establishing better standards for infrastructure investment internationally, the law enforcement actions and investigations that have gone on against apt10.\\\\xa0\", \"the main hacking arm of the chinese communist party, i think have been very effective as well, combined with sanctions and other actions against the aggressive arms of the party. but really, i think the most important thing for us to do, and i argue this in a chapter battlegrounds entitled turning weakness into strength is to take what the chinese communist party sees as sources of weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strengths. what does the party fear? the party fears that the people, the chinese people, might want to have a say in how theyre governed so we should strengthen our democratic processes. the party fears rule of law. we should strengthen rule of law in the united states and with countries that are working to strengthen rule of law in their countries, the party fears freedom of press, freedom of the expression. we need to strengthen our authoritative sources of information and recognize that investigative journalism is a great counter to some of these pernicious strategies that the parties are pursuing. so i think that part of it is defensive, but part of it is more introspective and trying to maintain our competitive advantages.\", \"michael morrell: this is intelligence matters. im michael morrell. were talking with former national security adviser h.r. mcmaster. so russia, how do you think about russia?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, russia is a significant threat to us because putin again, is examining the assumptions of previous policies. putin is not going to become like the grinch on christmas eve. right, his heart is not going to get too big as the size gets bigger and hes not going to decide, ok, well maybe the future of russia does lie more with the west and treat the united states and europe and others differently. putin is driven by a sense of honor lost after the breakup of the soviet union. he is also driven by this associated desire to restore russia to national greatness. hes also cognizant, though, of the fact that he cannot compete with this on our own terms. and so what his theory of victory is, is to drag us all down and then to be the last man standing and the means that hes using to do this. i describe the chinese approach of cooption, coercion and concealment. and i use alliteration in the russian chapters as well.\\\\xa0\", it is a campaign of disruption, disinformation and denial to try to disrupt us, to disrupt our effective governance, to disrupt us economically and to use economic coercion when he can, such as he has done in europe effectively from time to time and with energy dependence. then to deny even his most egregious acts, especially the sustained campaign of cyber enabled information warfare against us, which is designed to polarize us, to pit us against each other, to reduce our confidence in who we are as a people and in our democratic institutions and principles and processes. russia is a dangerous threat for for these reasons. and the best way to counter the first step is to pull the curtain back on this activity, to educate ourselves about it, to be less susceptible to russian information, to not be our own worst enemies, as i think both political parties in many instances have because they compromise and they compromised our principles to score some partisan political points and in doing so, make themselves vulnerable to russian disinformation and propaganda., michael morrell: then what about raising the cost to him of doing this? is that an option here in terms of deterring him?, \"gen. mcmaster: absolutely. this is what i advocated for in battlegrounds is that we have to impose costs on the kremlin, on putin, that exceed those that he factors in at the beginning of his decision making process. it was my last day really in an oval office meeting, it was the day that president trump decided to impose significant costs on russia in response to the attempted\\\\xa0 poisoning, murder of sergei skripal and his daughter with with a banned military grade nerve agent and an act that put thousands of uk citizens at risk. and it was at that on that occasion that we expelled you over 60 undeclared intelligence agents that hits putin where it matters. because these are agents that were critical to his sustained campaign of subversion against us. and we impose significant costs, additional costs on russia through sanctions and other actions, the closing of the san francisco consulate, as you know, michael, was a major intelligence collection platform for the russians here in silicon valley and the bay area. so, that was significant and i think that sent a strong message. now, after navalnys poisoning, id like to see us do the same thing, you know, and as hes infiltrating more little green men now into belarus and as he continues to enable the serial episodes of mass homicide, that is the syrian civil war, to support hawthornes way perpetuating violence in libya.\\\\xa0\", \"michael morrell: im michael morell. were talking with h.r. mcmaster, former national security adviser to president trump and author of the just published book \", \" by the way, if you missed any of todays show, you can listen to it as a podcast. just search \", \"wherever you get your podcasts. lets talk about north korea. give us your sense on north korea?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, thanks, michael. of course, its important for us to recognize going in right that north korea is the only communist hereditary dictatorship in the world. and it is the nature of the kim family regime that we have to take into account when were considering the danger that the regime poses to the world if it does possess the most destructive weapons on earth. the kim family regime is driven mainly by this drive to remain in power. it is, of course, known as the hermit kingdom. it is a gulag state that fears any kind of opening to the world. and it is a regime that across now three generations of dictators has been committed to unifying the korean peninsula under the so-called red banner. and i think as we look at north koreas pursuit of the most destructive weapons on earth, we have to be at least open to the possibility that it wants those weapons to coerce the united states off the peninsula as the first step in the forcible reunification of the peninsula. and, of course, that would that would be the form of a destructive war.\", \"gen. mcmaster: its also important, i think, for us to recognize that it is highly unlikely that north korea wants nuclear weapons just to deter us. north korea already had a very significant deterrence capability with its conventional weapons. and the fact that its so many thousands of artillery pieces are within the range of of seoul, south korea. and then also, i think its important to recognize that every act of aggression on the korean peninsula since the north invaded the south in june of 1950 has been initiated by the north. the other aspect of this problem, michael, that is very important to consider is that if north korea gets the weapon is recognized as a as a nuclear power, like who doesnt get one after that? right. this japan starts to have conversation with south korea. by the way, north korea never met a weapon it didnt try to sell to somebody excluding its nuclear program until the israeli defense force bombed that facility in 2007. so its very dangerous. i think its dangerous as well because of the ideology that drives this regime. its a warped ideology. this is the zushi ideology which has turned deprivation into a sign of virtue and racial superiority. and the north korean people have gone through generations of brainwashing. so this is a big problem, michael. i think that the approach that is in place now, the strategy of maximum pressure, its the best course of action. i think we have to test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince kim jong un that he is safer without the weapons than he is with them. i think it will be important for whoever is sworn in on january 20th that they recognize that we should not repeat the failed pattern of previous efforts, not allow north korea to draw us into negotiations with an act of aggression and with the demands of big payoff up front just for the privilege of talking with them. to not again, engage in long, drawn out negotiations that delivers a weak agreement that he immediately breaks again.\", \"michael morrell: youve said something here that i think is really important, because i think the conventional wisdom is that he wants these weapons for deterrence. right. that hes worried about us attacking him. but youre arguing that its more than that. that this gets to the heart of what north korea has always wanted, which is to reunify the peninsula, which i think is a really important point here that changes how you think about how you have to deal with him?\", \"gen. mcmaster: this is an argument, michael, for strategic empathy. right? to view these complex challenges from the perspective of the other and unless you do that,\\\\xa0 youre susceptible to mirror imaging. and, of course, my research for the book, \", , you know that sensitized me to this. it was in the run up to the vietnam war where some of those who were planning the vietnam strategy development, the strategy actually referred to the reasonable man theory of english common law and assumed that ho chi minh would respond as the theoretical reasonable man. would respond without taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played in driving and constraining the north vietnamese leadership., \"michael morrell: do you think at the end of the day its possible to convince him that he would be better off, that he would be more secure without these weapons?\", \"gen. mcmaster: i do think its possible, and the reason i think its possible because weve never really put maximum pressure on the north. and so we have this opportunity now thanks really to the tremendous work by ambassador nikki haley when she was at the u.n. as you know, michael, these u.n. security council sanctions on north korea are unprecedented and reach. the key now, though, is to enforce them. of course, the key country that needs to enforce them is china. and i think if china doesnt enforce them, if china continues to be complicit with illicit financial flows into and out of the country, to continue to provide energy and other materials to the north that are limited by these sanctions. then i think its time for us to consider secondary sanctions and maybe on chinese financial institutions.\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think as we see the smuggling of coal and the transshipment of coal and oil and fuel, i think that under article two, i think the president could use article two authority to interdict those ships. as you know, michael, this is something we cant really talk about. there are other means of putting pressure on the north. i think that we havent done it yet. i think we have to at least test the thesis because the alternatives are so bleak of either accepting north korea as a nuclear power and coping with that threat or a war. right. that would be very costly, i think its worth pursuing.\", \"michael morrell: we still have more to discuss with general mcmaster and well be right back with our final segment.\\\\xa0\", \"michael morrell: were back with more intelligence matters, im michael morrell. our guest is h.r. mcmaster, senior fellow at both stanford universitys hoover institution and its graduate school of business. so, sir, let me ask you about another tough one, iran.\", gen. mcmaster: on iran, what i tell the story of in , \", michael, is we have to view the problem of iran with two fundamental considerations foremost in our minds. the first is the ideology of the revolution and how that drives iranian leadership and the iranian leadership is the supreme leader and the guardian council and the islamic revolutionary guards corps. we have this fantasy i think that the reformers, the republicans, within iraq are going to prevail. they lost, the revolutionaries are in charge. the hardliners are in charge. and whenever they put this forward, the shop window of minister zarif, their foreign minister or president rouhani, thats all youre getting is the shop window. that ideology is it drives the iranian regime to continue its four decade long proxy war against the great satan, the united states, the little satan, israel, the arab monarchies and the west broadly. and so we have to consider the ideology of the regime and and this 40 year long proxy war.\", \"gen. mcmaster: what i argue for in the book is to force the iranian regime to make a choice. you can either be treated like a normal nation or you can continue to wage this proxy war, to support terrorist organizations and keep the middle east enmeshed in this perpetual state of sectarian civil war. the choice is yours, and to impose that choice, i think what we should not do is lift the arms embargo to the regime. what we should not do is lift any of the sanctions. in fact, we should impose the costs on the regime to constrain the resources they have available to continue their proxy wars against us, but then also ultimately maybe to convince the iranian people. that they ought to have a government in place and im not talking about like a 2003 regime change, but a government in place that shifts away from its permanent hostility to the united states, israel and the west. i think thats the only path that i see forward. i think our policies ought to aim to effect that change in the regimes permanent hostility. and until it does any agreement with them, it cant be trusted and any agreement with them that allows them to escape. making that choice like the iran nuclear deal did, i think is to our disadvantage.\", \"michael morrell: so you dont see the regime changing policy on its own. do you think that has to be forced internally by the iranian people? is that fair?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, michael, i think on iran, its important to keep two considerations in mind in crafting a strategy toward iran. first of all, that its the ideology of the regime that drives their hostile behavior toward us. and we have to recognize that its the supreme leader, its the guardian council, its islamic revolutionary guards corps, who are in charge. right. there was a struggle, you know, across the history of iran since the revolution in 1979 between the republicans and the revolutionaries. hey, the revolutionaries won. and and we have to recognize that the second consideration is that this regime has waged a four decade long proxy war against the great satan, us, the little satan, israel, the arab monarchies and the west generally. we have to craft our strategy in recognition of this regimes permanent hostility to us. of course, i think the best way to approach it in the title of the chapter in \", is , \", forcing the regime to make a choice of either being a responsible nation and then being treated as such or suffering the consequences. and this is why i think its very important to keep the arms embargo in place. i think its very important to keep the sanctions in place on the regime to, in the short term, reduce the resources it has available to wage this proxy war and in the long term, hopefully convince the iranian people to demand a change in the nature of the government such that it ceases as permanent hostility.\", \"michael morrell: okay, islamic extremism, its waned a bit in the threat, but its still there. from west africa, to the middle east, to south asia, to southeast asia. how do you think about that problem long term?\\\\xa0\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think the reason that we havent had another attack on the scale of the most devastating terrorist attack in history of september 11th, 2001, is our tremendous intelligence professionals, our diplomats, our military whos been engaged against this threat from jihadist terrorist organizations since 9/11. what im concerned about, michael, is that these groups, i think are more dangerous today than they were maybe even on september 10th, 2001. and thats because, of course, those who committed the mass murder attacks against us on 9/11 were the mujahideen alumni of the resistance to the soviet occupation of afghanistan. well, now the al-qaida alumni, the isis alumni, the lashkar-e-taiba alumni are orders of magnitude greater and they have access to more and more destructive capabilities. and the reason weve been safe is because weve been engaged and now we have this narrative of ending endless wars and disengaging. well, i think what americans need to know is that we are engaged so we can enable others to bear the brunt of this fight. i mean, this disengagement from afghanistan, i think is a tragedy. the way that weve gone about this, i think we should recognize the sacrifices of our longest war and in particular that 10 of our courageous servicemen, soldiers, gave their lives for our country, our security this year. but we have to also recognize that 30 afghan soldiers and police a day die defending the freedoms that theyve enjoyed since the defeat of the taliban in 2001 a removal of the taliban from power. so i think that we need to make a sustained argument to the american people for engagement with this problem of jihadist terrorism. because if we dont, michael, well go back to 1998. remember when we after the embassy bombings, we fired a few cruise missiles and called it a day. right, that didnt work out.\", \"michael morrell: the last issue i want to ask you about is venezuela, which i know you care about. my understanding is that when you arrived at the white house, you were going over the issues and you kind of stumbled on venezuela and said, hey, you know whats going on there? that doesnt look like were paying attention to this, talk about venezuela and why its important?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, its immensely important because this is a humanitarian catastrophe in venezuela. its a humanitarian catastrophe thats brought on by an authoritarian regime that is denying the venezuelan people a say in how theyre governed. when we looked at the problem and the nature of the maduro regime and the chavista movement, we concluded that this was, again, a corrupt government that is using criminalized patronage networks to effect control of its people. it uses these motorcycle gangs and militias to overwhelm any kind of opposition. it ended the constitution. so we said whats should our goal be? our goal should be to work with others, to work with like-minded countries, to effect a restoration of constitutional rule in venezuela. and to do that, we felt as if we had to pursue three objectives. one of those objectives would be to try to strengthen the opposition. right. to help the opposition come together. i think you saw that with the rise of bolsonaro. you know, who was really from the people. you know, hes not a member of the caracas polo club, for example. i think hes somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged now so significantly under chávez, and now maduro.\", \"gen. mcmaster: the second objective would be for the people to be able to attribute their grievances back to the government, not to blame the yankees, you know, for example. and the third related to that would be to try to galvanize really popular support for restoration of constitutional government. i think the measures we put in place were sound. of course, they have proven inadequate. and i think we thought that economic sanctions would maybe have a significant effect. but the reason they havent had a bigger effect is theres a huge black market, illicit economy thats run by maduro. he uses that to sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gangs of thugs who really prevent any real opposition from gaining traction. but i think im proud of what we did in this period of time. we worked very closely with partners, especially in the western hemisphere, mexico, under the foreign minister of the great luis videgaray, who was a wonderful partner, took a leading role in much of the work that we did. we tryd to get the organization of american states and others to do more. but it was really the community of like-minded nations brazil, colombia, peru, panama, argentina. we worked very closely together on this problem and i think remain committed to trying to effect a restoration of constitutional government in venezuela.\", \"michael morrell: youve been fantastic with your time. i just want to ask you two more questions, we have a couple of minutes left, so well need to be quick here.\", \"michael morrell: the first is that in order to deal with all of these problems that youve talked about, you know, we need a healthy national security toolkit. healthy diplomacy, healthy intelligence capabilities, healthy military capabilities. whats your assessment sort of overall of where we are with our national security toolkit?\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think were in good shape thanks to the extremely dedicated civil servants and military professionals, intelligence professionals who we have across our government. but i think what is needed more than anything is a higher degree of what i argue in \", \" is, strategic competence, and thats the ability to integrate the elements of national power so that theyre applied in a way that are synergistic. the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. i think at times we get it right, but most often we get it wrong. and our approach to these complex problems is fragmented. its inconsistent. its as i mentioned, you know, based on flawed assumptions about the nature of the problem. i think what i would like to see as well these days is even more of a concerted effort to foster multinational cooperation as i write in \", \". i mean, none of these problems are solvable by any one country. so its very important for us to create the right venues for us to come together. not only to work on a discrete issue or event together, but really to think about these complex challenges. to frame them together and then to apply our competitive advantages between our like minded countries. so that we do have a synergistic effect and and so that we can build a better future for generations to come.\", \"michael morrell: the last question, i think anybody whos listened to the podcast up to this point is going to think, wow, that is a hard, tough list. i wonder at the end of the day, if youre optimistic or if you are pessimistic that were going to get this right going forward.\", \"gen. mcmaster: michael, im optimistic about it. im optimistic about it even as we emerge from this\\\\xa0 triple crisis. of the pandemic, the recession associated with it and the divides in our society, laid bare by george floyds murder and the protests and civil unrest that followed it. i think whats great about our democracy is we are self-correcting. the american people have a say in how theyre governed. they can demand better. and the reason i wrote \", \" is i think if the american people understand these challenges, they will demand a better foreign policy from from our elected leaders. you know, our founders knew that our democracy was going to require continuous nurturing. its still true today. and i believe that we do have significant problems at home. but we also have to confront these challenges abroad because we know from the covid-19 pandemic that problems that develop abroad can only be dealt with at an exorbitant price once they reach our shores. so the argument of battlegrounds is an argument for sustained engagement with the world.\", michael morrell: the book is , \". the author is h.r. mcmaster. general, thank you very much for joining us

site, we earn an affiliate commission., by,  , by h. r. mcmaster, on his first morning as president trump’s national security adviser, in 2017, h. r. mcmaster invited me to drop by his office. he had heard that the new york times was getting ready to report on ,  that attempted to sabotage north korea’s missile programs with cyberstrikes. “is this the revelation of the modern-day enigma codes?” he asked, the military historian searching for an analogy from the world war ii operation to crack german ciphers., it was a bracing start for what turned out to be a wild 13-month effort to devise a modern-day security strategy for a president with no experience, more interest in cutting deals than designing a long-term strategy — and an unwillingness to sit for intelligence briefings, much less discussion of containing an angry, decaying russia or of a 50-year plan to compete with a rising china. so “battlegrounds” is, at its heart, the mcmaster strategic plan that might have come to fruition had he worked for a president who was interested in strategic plans., long before he walked into the west wing, mcmaster was the closest thing the army had to a soldier-scholar. his book about vietnam, ,  was a devastating account of how the united states had a flawed decision-making process that was largely based on self-deception., in many ways, “battlegrounds” is the sequel, seeking to ask the question of why — not whether — the united states, at another moment of protests in the streets and bitter partisan divides, is losing its ability to shape the world. but the answers this time are different, in mcmaster’s view., the key to his argument is that america is suffering from what hans morgenthau called “strategic narcissism,” or, in mcmaster’s words, “the tendency to view the world only in relation to the united states and to assume that the future course of events depends primarily on u.s. decisions or plans.” it’s hard to argue with that premise: every new president comes to office assuming that the world is waiting for direction from washington. some countries are. others are looking for power vacuums they can fill, each in its own way., that’s been the story of the past two decades. russia has emerged as a disrupter, knowing that it has neither the money nor the technology to take the united states on directly. china has become a builder — why threaten to cut undersea cables, as vladimir putin’s submarine force does, if you can dominate global communications? as rob joyce, an n.s.a. official who worked for mcmaster as the white house cybersecurity coordinator, said: “russia is the hurricane. … china is climate change.”, mcmaster realized that, and devoted much of his time in the west wing to writing a “national security strategy” that would reorient the united states away from nearly two decades of counterterrorism and toward countering moscow and beijing, which he called “revisionist powers.” it was an impressive document. unfortunately, the president under whose name it was published, aides concede, did not read it., “battlegrounds” expands on the written strategy — the one the white house has barely mentioned since it was published — and makes a strong case for containing russia, pushing back on chinese influence and using american leverage, and allies, to confront iran and north korea. what washington needs, mcmaster argues, is an integrated approach that recognizes that the old tools that drove saddam hussein out of kuwait in 1991, when mcmaster served, are pretty useless 30 years later., he starts with russia. “the united states and europe were ill prepared for russia’s toxic combination of disinformation, denial, dependence and disruptive technologies,” he says, a recognition that what happened in 2016 was not that america’s radar was off. it’s that the radar was never built. fortunately, it has since been pieced together, and in the 2020 presidential contest, everyone from facebook to twitter to the united states cyber command has been pushing back. disinformation has been blocked, clumsily. , , at least briefly., unfortunately, mcmaster’s boss was not on board with this approach. in mcmaster’s time, he notes, president trump often said improving relations with russia “would be a good thing, not a bad thing,” while succumbing to putin’s flattery and treating his criminal actions “with dismissiveness and moral equivalency.” and, of course, the repeated references to “the russia hoax,” which meant no one in the president’s circle could discuss election interference without dreading an eruption triggered by trump’s fear that the legitimacy of the election was being questioned., mcmaster never deals head-on with the fundamental problem — that the administration had, on paper, a defensible russia strategy, and the president kept undermining it. instead, he cites his top russia aide, fiona hill, who, he writes, always warned that “putin seeks to divide; americans and europeans should not divide themselves.”, china, the climate-changer, is, of course, immune to containment strategies. if the old cold war was largely a military contest, version 2.0 is a military, diplomatic, economic and technological contest. that change led to a misappraisal of the challenge: as mcmaster points out, a succession of administrations convinced themselves that, over time, china would conform to a western-built system. (trump succumbed to a different illusion: that the chinese were all dealmakers, like the property developers he knew.), crucial to mcmaster’s analysis is china’s strategy to wire together its own collection of allies and dependent powers — selling them controlled-in-china technology, from huawei’s networks to, after mcmaster departed, tiktok’s addictive app., “it took the united states a decade and a half to understand the immensity of the trojan horse it had let in,” he says of how the united states blindly let a chinese telecommunications giant gain ground, while american firms exited the market. but the reader yearns for mcmaster’s solution. ban chinese technology? maybe — president trump is trying — but even then china will dominate 40 percent or more of the world’s telecommunications networks. embrace an industrial policy that will win back the market?, it is in dealing with the two biggest failures of the trump administration, iran and north korea, that mcmaster sounds the loudest alarms. while he was a major critic of president obama’s 2015 nuclear deal with tehran, and criticizes obama’s aides for overlooking iran’s support of terrorism and terrorist regimes, he reports that internally he argued for staying inside the deal and using trump’s threats to toss it aside as leverage., but the president wouldn’t think that many chess moves ahead, and dispensed with the whole deal a month after mcmaster left. now he fears that the united states, without allies to confront iran, may slip into the place we are with other nuclear powers that washington once declared could never possess nuclear arms:, “pakistan provides a stark warning. iran could become, like pakistan today, a nuclear-armed state in which terrorists already enjoy a support base. the greatest threat to humanity in the coming decades may lie at the nexus between terrorists and the most destructive weapons on earth.”, north korea, of course, already has those weapons — and a lot more fuel for them now than when the trump administration arrived with its threats of “fire and fury” if they were not turned over immediately. it was the president’s ego that got in the way., mcmaster knew, he says, that as soon as kim jong-un proposed a summit, the president “would find a historic first meeting between a north korean leader and a u.s. president irresistible.” not a single weapon or missile has been dismantled. but the sanctions regime is in tatters, undercut by russia and china., which takes me back to mcmaster’s question his first day: are we facing the “modern-day enigma codes”? it turns out the enigma this time is us. americans want the unrivaled power, the global influence, and the economic growth and freedom that come with it, the kind we enjoyed with little challenge at the end of world war ii and then, briefly, after the collapse of the soviet union. but we want it free — without the strategic investments in the world, without forward-deployed troops, without marshaling the power of technologies america largely invented., the biggest of mcmaster’s “battlegrounds” is here at home., advertisement][from ,  to ,  to the war between armenia and azerbaijan over the , , russia is surrounded by mounting instability. according to matthew rojansky, the director of the kennan institute at the woodrow wilson institute for scholars, president vladimir putin and his top advisers only have themselves to blame for these crises on russia’s periphery, given their active assertion of “veto rights” over political outcomes that they find unfavorable, including any signs that a country is realigning away from russia and toward the west., in many cases, this has meant staunch russian support for friendly authoritarian regimes in post-soviet states, leading to mass demonstrations or other forms of unrest. “in a way,” rojansky told wpr’s elliot waldman in an interview on the trend lines podcast this week, russia “has made

being talked about during the presidential election campaign., the united states’ russia policy over the past four years has been profoundly dysfunctional. president donald trump has relished his cozy relationship with russian president vladimir putin, denigrated nato, scuttled arms control agreements, and allowed moscow to become an influential player again in the middle east, africa, and latin america. he has refused to act on credible reports of russia offering bounties for killing u.s. soldiers in afghanistan. a deeply alarmed u.s. congress, meanwhile, has been ratcheting up ever tougher sanctions on russia for meddling in the 2016 u.s. elections, and for fomenting the ongoing proxy war in ukraine. three senators even wrote a nasty ,  to the mayor of the german baltic port town of sassnitz, where the north stream 2 undersea gas pipeline from russia comes ashore, threatening him with reprisals., the depth of the stalemate in washington was illustrated this august, when two bipartisan groups of experienced russia hands dueled it out in competing letters. one ,  for a renewal of nuclear arms control and diplomacy, combined with more flexible (read: fewer) sanctions; the

term for trump would presumably be an amplified version of the first (hard to imagine as that might be). he might bring back u.s. troops from afghanistan, the middle east, and europe, and attempt to make an ally of russia against china. it could well be the end of nato. democratic candidate joe biden, in contrast, is known to be sharply critical of putin: in a television interview last week, he ,  to russia as “the biggest threat to america.” yet as much as biden cherishes the united states’ alliances, as president he would be bogged down by domestic concerns. abroad, he would be focused on china above all else., emotions in moscow regarding the most desirable outcome of the u.s. elections appear to be mixed. a second dose of trump would presumably tax the nerves of a kremlin already wrongfooted by the pandemic, a tanking economy, and persistent protests in its regions. putin seemed to concede as much when he ,  the challenger’s son hunter against accusations of dodgy business

europe—especially for the civil societies from the balkans to belarus still seeking to chart a westward course. whatever the outcome of the nov. 3 election, a much larger part (if not all) of the burden of regional security will fall to europe, which urgently needs a common policy that addresses the risks and threats posed by russia to the continent. if there is a sympathetic administration in washington that is willing to support and collaborate with it, so much the better. if the administration is hostile, then the task is all the more urgent.,  is a senior fellow in the center on the

growing number of lockheed martin f-35 lightning ii stealth fighters possessed by european air forces will give the nato alliance an edge over russia in high-intensity conflict., that’s according to a report by think tank rand, released last month, which explains that russian political and military leaders are already concerned about nato’s advantage in the air domain – a worry that is likely to worsen as the number of fifth-generation aircraft grows to the west., f-35a at heart of texas air show, there are seven european nato nations that operate or plan to buy the f-35: belgium, denmark, italy, the netherlands, and norway, poland and uk., by 2025, those militaries ought to collectively own more than 200 examples of the stealth fighter. “this will exceed the number of us fifth-generation aircraft stationed in the european theater by a wide margin,” says the report. the combined force of f-35s possessed by european allies is likely to approach 400 aircraft by 2030 and would represent roughly 30 percent of the combined fleet., for its part, russia plans to acquire 76 examples of sukhoi su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet by 2028. moscow said recently the first such stealth aircraft would be delivered by december 2020., european allied air forces have around 1,900 fourth-generation fighters comprising types such as the dassault rafale, eurofighter typhoon and lockheed martin f-16. the combined force currently has less than 100 f-35s fielded, according to rand., those fourth-generation aircraft would be vulnerable in a high-intensity conflict against russia, a country with robust surface-to-air missile defences., “during the opening phases of a conflict with russia, vulnerability to advanced ground-based threats would constrain the roles of most fourth-generation and so-called fourth-generation-plus platforms,” says the report. “as long as an extensive [integrated-air defence] threat persisted, more advanced platforms such as the rafale or eurofighter could theoretically perform strike missions inside the threat zone in conjunction with fifth-generation platforms, although this approach could yield unacceptable attrition.”, but with fourth-generation fighters likely still to make up 70% of european nato air forces by 2030, the alliance needs to find ways to make better use of the aircraft., the fast jets could be used to launch long-range missile strikes from beyond the range of russia’s surface-to-air missiles. and, if upgraded with active electronically scanned array (aesa) radars, european fourth-generation fighters would be more capable on defence. aesa radars can detect, track and identify more targets, faster and at much longer distances, notes rand., “the resultant situational awareness and ability to defeat multiple threats at the same time makes an aesa capability essential for aspects of high-intensity operations—for example, to intercept cruise missiles,” says the think tank report. “the french decision to procure aesa [for the rafale fighter] is informed by the opportunity to provide a 50% increase in detection range, including of low-observable targets, and maximize the value of new weapon systems such as the meteor beyond visual range missile.”, the mbda meteor is an active radar guided beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile that is reported to have a reach of 54nm (100km). in theory, if a fourth-generation fighter like the rafale has an aesa radar and is armed with a beyond-visual-range missile like the meteor it ought to be able to see and hit incoming russian aircraft, while staying out of reach itself., however, beside the addition of aesa on the rafales, other european fourth-generation aircraft lack the advanced radar., “uncertainties remain as to which nations will invest in aesa radar technology, advanced and long-range munitions, and secure communication links, among other important capabilities,” says rand. “the degree to which european air forces acquire these technologies will directly impact their ability to contribute to the range of combat air missions expected in a high-intensity conflict.”, for its part, the uk royal air force announced in september plans to add the ecrs mk2 aesa radar to 40 examples of its tranche 3 production-standard typhoons, with initial operational capability targeted for 2025., ultimately, to make the most of a mixed fleet of fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft nato will need to invest in communications technologies to link the jets, as well as training exercises to practice coordinating the combat aircraft., f-35’s can communicate among themselves with their multifunction advanced data link (madl), a low probability of intercept communications link. rand points to a fourth and fifth generation fighter operating concept called “combat intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (isr) mode” described by justin bronk of the royal united services institute think tank., “in the ‘combat isr’ mode, a four-ship flight of f-35s connected by madl generates situational awareness and shares targeting data with legacy platforms that can then fire their payloads from outside the range of the most capable of the enemy’s air defences,” explains rand. the fourth- and fifth-generation combat aircraft would communicate and pass targeting information with the link 16 system, adds the report., however, this might be a vulnerability point. “it is reasonable to assume that the russian military would seek to disrupt this synergy during a conflict, particularly in light of recent russian investments in ew capabilities,” rand says., still, european nato militaries are getting more practice with the f-35. “already, allies have undertaken initial steps to establish common tactics, techniques, and procedures for incorporating fifth-generation assets into combined operations through targeted exercises as well as preliminary synthetic training systems that link fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft,” the think tank says., one of the highest hurdles to nato collaboration might be investment in aircraft readiness. “to be operationally relevant during a theatre conflict, nato’s air forces must maintain a sufficient number of available aircraft, munitions, and aircrew,” says rand. “currently, most european air forces maintain around half of their existing fleets or less at mission-capable status, with some allies falling below that mark.”, what’s more, many fourth-generation aircraft are suffering from “rising maintenance costs from platform age, operational wear and tear resulting from a high operational tempo, and challenges associated with spare parts pipelines serve as significant constraints to aircraft availability”, says the report., the new f-35 also has teething problems, including its autonomic logistics information system, a support system that is so troubled that it has to be replaced across the worldwide fleet., rand recommends a number of solutions to nato aircraft readiness problems including making public data on mission capable rates. it also suggests “public agreement by nato leaders on standard availability objectives could provide renewed political and budgetary focus on efficient and adequately funded maintenance and sustainment”., ultimately, rand concludes that the growing number of stealth aircraft in europe means the “trend lines lead in the right direction”., “with additional budgetary and policy attention to increasing readiness, european allies have the opportunity to significantly enhance combat airpower over the coming decade,” says the think tank., the dod had expressed confidence as recently as august that iot&e would be complete by march 2021, after multiple delays since the process started in december 2018.\\\\xa0, the us air force has declared that the northrop grumman apg-83 scalable agile beam radar has met full operational readiness for use on the air national guard’s lockheed martin

covid-19 has wrought worldwide disruption, so too has it affected the un open-ended working group (oewg) on cybersecurity—the only forum open to all un member states for deliberating how to promote a peaceful and stable cyberspace. because the pandemic prevented its final in-person meeting, the oewg missed its mandated july 2020 deadline for a consensus report containing agreements on norms, international law, and other leading global cybersecurity issues., more on:, \\\\n , \\\\n , \\\\n , \\\\n , \\\\n , \\\\n , \\\\n , \\\\n , the oewg has since been ,  [pdf]; its final substantive in-person meeting is tentatively scheduled for march 2021. after two online summer sessions, another virtual session from september 29 to october 1 set the oewg rolling again, including a proposed new format for the future. but the late september meeting also marked the debut of a novel pair of conflicting resolutions from the united states and russia., although the two draft resolutions have been circulated among un member states, neither are yet final nor public. the proposed u.s. resolution calls on states to wait until the current group of governmental experts (gge) and oewg meetings are completed in early 2021 before formally proposing a new process to address cyber issues at the un. in contrast, the draft russian resolution calls for a new oewg to be convened from 2021-2025, despite the fact that the current oewg has not yet finished its work. the russian resolution would also reaffirm the right of states to combat “the dissemination of false or distorted news” and recognize states’ “duty” to refrain from any “defamatory campaign” for interfering in other states’ domestic affairs., the clashing resolutions risk repeating , , when two parallel resolutions from both sides were adopted in 2018—creating the oewg while renewing the longstanding gge. now, the russian push for a new and extended oewg seems counterproductive, especially given a proposed new “, ” [pdf] (poa) format for un cybersecurity deliberations, which is currently under discussion in the oewg., released for discussion on october 1, by france and egypt, the proposed poa has quickly gained the support of a diverse range of at least forty countries, with several others—including all african union member states—also rumored to be leaning toward endorsement. recently ,  by french scholars and analyzed in an informal ,  [pdf], it seeks to replace the dual-track discussions of the gge/oewg with a single, permanent un forum., however, the russian push for a new and extended oewg raises doubts as to whether the call for a poa can achieve consensus support, which it needs in order to be endorsed in the final oewg report. if so, the poa could potentially be put to the un general assembly as a resolution later on, perhaps incorporated into a future u.s. resolution. in this case the poa, initially pitched to eliminate the redundancy of the two parallel un cyber processes, could simply emerge as a replacement to the gge—while existing alongside an extended oewg. such a dual-track scenario would run contrary to the objectives of the poa and could substantially reduce its effectiveness.,

\\\\xa0[pdf] from may to prolong the oewg mandate. the announcement momentarily lurched the oewg process into uncertainty (as it meant the oewg would have to conclude by its original july deadline), and was followed by a fiery ,  [pdf] by russia at a june 15 informal meeting which excoriated the existing oewg draft report. russian bluster soon subsided, though, and russia later accepted a plan to reschedule the final oewg session., such behavior from the russian delegation, combined with its premature resolution calling for a five-year oewg to study how to move forward rather than to work with an existing, widely supported proposal like the poa, raises questions about the extent to which russia seeks meaningful outcomes from the oewg., the one-year-old oewg, which, unlike the gge is open to

promising other nations help on the pandemic., by,  , dr. twigg is a professor of political science., before regulators ,  earlier this month, there were good reasons to be concerned about president trump’s push for a coronavirus vaccine. but he had already missed becoming the first world leader to get one approved. vladimir putin of russia had already done it. and in stark contrast to mr. trump’s “america first” approach, mr. putin is using his under-tested vaccine as part of a global full-court press to win friends and enhance his country’s soft power., on aug. 11, the russian ministry of health formally approved the sputnik v vaccine, developed by the gamaleya research institute of epidemiology and microbiology in moscow. its announcement was a splashy event. a ,  featured a recording of the beeps broadcast from space in 1957 confirming that the first soviet sputnik satellite had reached orbit. those historical echoes pointedly evoked the idea that russia was no. 1 again., but at that point, the vaccine hadn’t even begun large-scale field trials, meaning that neither its safety nor efficacy had been fully vetted, and its early-phase clinical trial data hadn’t been released. since then, a peer-reviewed publication of ,  in the journal the lancet has raised alarm bells for some scientists who are concerned about ,  in the data, which a top russian scientist has denied., still, buoyant news of the vaccine saturates russia’s state-controlled media, and the country stands poised to leverage sputnik into a significant diplomatic coup. it’s yet another instance — on top of america’s pullout from syria, its exit from the paris climate accord and its planned withdrawal from the world health organization — where the departure of the united states from the global stage has created a vacuum that mr. putin has been delighted to fill., because vaccines are administered to healthy people, they have especially high regulatory hurdles to clear. , , designed to pick up rare side effects and to test effectiveness , , generally involve thousands or tens of thousands of people. at approval, the sputnik vaccine trial included just 76 people., the ,  is currently taking up to 40,000 volunteers through final-stage trials while simultaneously offering the vaccine to frontline medics and teachers. jumping the gun carries potentially deadly consequences, including renewed spread of the virus if a weakly effective vaccine lulls people into complacency on mask-wearing and physical distancing before herd immunity has been established., in the united states, the vaccines that are likely to be candidates for emergency-use authorizations by the food and drug administration are at least partly through phase-three testing., of course, sputnik may turn out to work just fine. russia has plenty of world-class scientists, and the gamaleya institute claims to have had a ,  the institute points to its development of an ebola vaccine and says sputnik is just a slightly modified version of its vaccine for middle east respiratory syndrome. there’s no evidence, though, that those vaccines have actually been deployed in a significant way anywhere in the world., now the scramble by countries to secure a potential coronavirus vaccine is looking a lot like a replay of what happened in the 1990s with antiretrovirals to combat h.i.v./aids and in 2009 with the h1n1 influenza vaccine: wealthy nations are buying up the initial supply, most likely leaving only leftovers for the rest of the world much later, if at all., the united states, for example, has secured advance purchase commitments for over 800 million doses of at least six candidate vaccines, all for itself. compounding an image of selfishness, the trump administration confirmed last month that it would not join , , an effort by dozens of countries to provide for the pooled procurement and equitable distribution of vaccines. this decision has created the political space for russia to cultivate the role of benefactor, even though it too has not joined the covax effort., russia is pitching dozens of countries licensing and production offers for sputnik. these

agreement for , ., all told, russia is claiming preliminary applications from ,  totaling , ., we don’t yet know the terms of these arrangements, and the “pending regulatory approval” clause is important; the deals might break down if sputnik’s safety and efficacy don’t pan out, though russia is trying to quell these fears by ,  for adverse reactions. if you’re the head of mexico or the philippines or brazil, reeling from months of medical, social and economic shock, you might be willing to take your chances on an incompletely tested and probably relatively cheap product from russia that you can get your hands on soon — especially if it looks like the united states and europe are leaving you to go it alone., mr. putin’s only rival for the role of global savior is ,  which is also rushing across regulatory milestones for vaccines and pushing deals, like ,  to help latin american and caribbean countries pay for them. china has also just joined covax., though the kremlin is engaged in pandemic-related belt tightening just like everyone else, it’s carrying little debt and has $120 billion in liquid assets in its sovereign wealth fund. it can afford some measure of vaccine generosity. the image-burnishing would be worth the price., sputnik is also fodder for a disinformation campaign ,  on russian state-controlled media. the claim is that only the russian vaccine is safe and effective., russia has a long history, dating back to soviet times, of health-related disinformation. the kgb planted “fake news” stories around the world in the early 1980s ,  was an american biological weapon. research has shown that russian trolls and bots have actively tried to ,  in vaccines in the united states since at least 2014., for russia, the sputnik vaccine goes far beyond national pride. mr. putin needs a showy win after a slew of recent bad press. he’s resorting to his standard playbook, leveraging a weak hand and exploiting u.s. missteps and vulnerabilities — unilateralism, neglect or abandonment of key allies, a retreat from established science — to bolster russia’s image and global position as a great power., russia is betting that its short-term diplomatic gains outweigh the longer-term reputational risk should problems arise with the sputnik vaccine. the united states could counter russia’s gambit and contribute to an important global public

rules-based order? where do you see it?”, this rift will become more pronounced and acquire new importance should joe biden win the us presidential election. \\\\xa0his victory would almost certainly lead to renewed attempts to engage in transatlantic cooperation on several policy areas – including, or maybe even starting with, russia. but, while a modicum of transatlantic unity and coordination would undoubtedly be good, the vision that guides it will matter a great deal., any new transatlantic russia policy needs to be based on new realities. attempts to recreate the past – to restore the international order of the 1990s, or even that of 2010 – would likely prove not just futile but counterproductive. in a chaotic world where a new order is not yet available, one needs to tread carefully and avoid overplaying one’s weakened hand – while still quietly working on the contours of the future.\\\\xa0, europe has three competing theories on how to approach russia – but all of them are rendered ineffective by the absence of a global order to give them structure., the difficulty of coming up with a workable approach to russia is reflected in europe’s russia policies. these days, europe has three competing theories on how to approach russia – but all of them are rendered ineffective by the absence of a global order to give them structure., the first – let’s call it the ‘lithuanian theory’ (to reflect the country’s recent activism on belarus), though it is shared by many in northern and eastern europe – consists of doubling down on the moral high ground. rooted in the ‘end of history’ thinking of the 1990s, this policy seeks to influence russia through criticism. it emphasises conditionality, treats dialogue as a reward, and resorts to symbolic acts – such as public displays of solidarity with pro-democracy forces and, of course, well-crafted speeches., competing with it is the french theory, embodied by president emmanuel macron’s attempts at outreach to russia. this is rooted in classical realpolitik balancing – the notion that, to avoid being crushed between the united states and china, europe needs to engage in some rapprochement with russia, regardless of our normative differences and moscow’s weak democratic credentials. in day-to-day politics, this view is expressed in efforts to make russia come round to europe’s – or sometimes just france’s – position., and, lingering somewhat sadly on the sidelines, there is the german theory. rooted in what academics would label liberal interdependence and confirmed by germany’s experience of unification, this theory assumes that cooperation and dialogue eliminate differences and lead to normative convergence. germany’s theory was dealt an early blow in 2011 – when vladimir putin’s return to the russian presidency showed that normative convergence had not happened – and it largely crashed after russia’s invasion of ukraine in 2014. still, up until last summer, germany has been looking for topics on which it could engage with russia, in the hopes that keeping the lines of communication open would have some good effects and help make the world a safer place., none of these approaches has worked recently. this is because, in a world in flux, moscow sees them all as fleeting theoretical constructs that are not fit to invest in, let alone build on. russian policymakers dismiss the lithuanian theory as a fantasy based on past dreams: moscow does not believe in the normative framework that forms its basis and, if it did, would fight against it., the french theory goes nowhere because moscow does understand who macron speaks for: himself, france, or europe. moscow sees his ideas as unrealistic and domestically driven. and, in any case, russia has no intention of limiting its freedom of action by prematurely siding with europe, especially given that it does not know whether the european union will become a policy actor to reckon with – or even if it is here to stay., russia’s scepticism about europe may also explain the dismal fate of the german theory. moscow has recently allowed its disputes with berlin to pile up in ways that may cost it its best european friend – apparently just because it does not care to save or invest in a relationship with germany and, by implication, europe., the us election result will affect the relative standing of these theories. a biden win might embolden the lithuanian theory, put the french theory on the defensive, and, depending on the circumstances, lend new energy to germany’s attempts to create patches of common ground in the west’s otherwise normatively adversarial relationship with russia (not to be confused with appeasement, which is a different thing entirely). proponents of each theory would seek to strengthen it by coordinating and cooperating with a biden administration, and they would want to help the new president succeed using their favoured approach (which would be different from trump’s). but, even so, moscow would likely remain reluctant to buy into any of this.\\\\xa0, this is not to say that it does not matter to russia who wins the us election. moscow does not have great expectations regarding either president, but the outcome will nonetheless have an impact on russia’s view on the direction the world is heading in. a second trump presidency would validate what, according to some russian experts, has always been putin’s world view: “instinctively, he is nationalist, unilateralist, and transactional”, ,  one russian analyst in december 2018. “for him, this is how the world works, and he wants to be vindicated. he wants to be able to tell the west he has always been right.”, a biden win would clash with this view. it would show the kremlin that the normative ideas that have underpinned the western policies are not dead; that they might make a comeback and, importantly, adapt to new realities. but adaptation cannot be taken for granted, and would inevitably take time. so, in either case, moscow will continue to see us policies as provisional – as a part of a temporary phase that one needs to wait out, to see what follows. moscow would view trump as a destroyer of the liberal system – and would welcome this – but not as an architect of a new system that it could engage with. and moscow would inevitably suspect a biden presidency of being just the last gasp of the former liberal consensus., the more biden urged a restoration of obama-era policies – not to mention those of the clinton era – the more moscow would see his actions as the death throes of a dying order and, as such, something to resist or ignore. conversely, the stronger biden proved in acknowledging that the world had changed, and that western policy needed to change too, the more seriously moscow would take him as a figure who could shape the future., the task is to find a way of shaping the world – including influencing russia – in the circumstances where the western ‘unipolar’ moment of the 1990s has passed, and even 500 years of relative western hegemony might be drawing to a close. this takes humility, caution, and a clear head. emotionally driven policies and rushed solutions do not fit. in a seminal study exploring the lessons that the soviet collapse might offer to the european union, ivan krastev ,  that, “in times of threats of disintegration, political actors should bet on flexibility and constrain their natural urge for rigidity and solutions intended to last (which, if and when they fail, can accelerate the momentum to disintegration).” this applies to the disintegration of the international order as well. attempts to forcefully recreate yesterday’s order will almost certainly lead to its final discreditation. efforts to build something new, forcefully and prematurely, will be stillborn. a fruitful policy requires a humble mindset and an understanding that, to shape the world order, the west needs to start at home, by making its own societies work; by remaking them. this will take time – but it has a chance of working., \\\\nthe european council on foreign relations does not take collective positions.

olympic games in amsterdam saw a number of important milestones, but one we still all benefit from today is revolutionising car parking. like other cities around europe in the late 1920s, the streets of amsterdam were filling up fast with cars, and during the games this issue was more pressing than ever, so organisers were forced to rack their brains in search of a solution. the allotted parking area next to the olympic stadium had room for a maximum of 2,000 vehicles, nowhere near enough to meet the demand during games time. in response, the city council provided a number of other sites that took parking capacity up to 3,500 vehicles and 2,000 bicycles. however, no sooner had one problem been solved than another was created: how were drivers and cyclists supposed to find their way to the new car parks? a solution was found in the shape of small blue panels with a white capital \"p\" in the middle. so it was that the international traffic sign for parking was born., \\\\n , \\\\n ,

think we should be more careful about the development of the situation with the pandemic, with geopolitical issues and other issues.\"\\\\xa0, nabiullina still considers the bias in interest rates to be to the downside, even if she is being cautious, \"because the covid escalation in autumn increases the disinflationary risks, and the risks for the demand, and we see that in medium-term perspective the disinflationary risks will prevail, of course,\" she said., \"and we think that our policy will remain ... through the end of next year. we think that instead of decisions of cutting

domestic goods consumption, but the resurgence of coronavirus cases in much of the world has forced the country to revise down its forecast for consumer and investor demand. a key part of that lies in demand for one of russia\\\\s most lucrative exports, oil, which saw a historic drop this spring and is still trading at more than 30% below pre-pandemic levels due to weak demand.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0, \"the autumn covid-19 escalation has led to some slowdown in the recovery, and that is why we revised our forecast for this year only plus half a percentage point, and we

 with an associate suspected of ties to russian intelligence. another trump associate sought inside information about , . the candidate himself ,  for his opponent’s emails, then tried ,  once he entered the white house., these were among the findings of the special counsel investigation of ties between russia and trump’s 2016 campaign. it produced a trove of damaging, or at least embarrassing, information about trump. yet in the 2020 campaign, democrats are largely ignoring the russia probe. it’s republicans who are making it a top campaign issue., trump and his supporters have cast the investigation as a witch hunt. it’s a refrain in trump tweets and speeches and on conservative media. in the run-up to the election, trump-appointed officials are ordering the declassification of documents that trump hopes will boost his campaign., while some of the revelations from the steady drip of newly declassified documents are serious, they do not undercut the reasons the russia probe was launched or its principal findings. an inspector general and a bipartisan senate panel have both concluded that the probe was valid., a look at the russia probe:, why was the investigation launched?, the fbi opened “crossfire hurricane” on july 31, 2016, after learning a trump campaign aide may have had advance knowledge that russian intelligence operatives had stolen democratic emails., a diplomat revealed that the aide, george papadopoulos, had boasted to him that he had heard russia had damaging information on democrat hillary clinton that it could release to harm her campaign., that may 2016 conversation triggered alarms within the fbi since the russian hacking operation, which resulted in the public disclosure of thousands of hacked emails, was not yet public knowledge., what did the investigation find?, the investigation was taken over by special counsel robert mueller, whose team documented substantial contacts between trump associates and russia. , that included a ,  with a russian lawyer that trump’s oldest son, donald trump jr., took with the expectation of receiving dirt on clinton, and a campaign chairman, paul manafort, who shared internal polling data with a contact whom a ,  characterized as a russian intelligence officer., a separate justice department inspector general report ,  was opened for a valid reason and did not find evidence of partisan bias. the senate committee’s report found manafort’s russian contacts posed a “grave” counterintelligence risk., was trump vindicated?, he was not criminally charged, but he wasn’t vindicated. , it is true mueller said his investigation did not find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between trump, or his associates, and russia to sway the election. but the investigation also described broad russian interference as well as a campaign that was eager to receive the help and expected to benefit from it. , mueller also investigated multiple episodes in which he found trump tried to exert control over the investigation, including by firing his fbi director, but mueller did not push forward with obstruction of justice charges, citing justice department policy against indicting a sitting president., what are the criticisms of the investigation?, most focus on one strand: the fbi’s suspicion that former campaign adviser carter page was a russian agent. page has denied that and was not charged with any wrongdoing., the inspector general identified major errors and omissions in applications the fbi submitted to a secretive court for permission to eavesdrop on page. for instance, the fbi failed to update the court as it received new information that undercut its original premise about page. it also highlighted how the warrant applications relied in part on democratic-funded research conducted by former british spy christopher steele., the problems are significant because they suggest the fbi misused intrusive surveillance powers or withheld information from the court. the fbi was alerted ,  of research, and a key source for steele was himself once investigated by the fbi for possible connections to russian intelligence, newly declassified documents show., multiple former fbi and justice department officials ,  the applications had they know then what they know now. fbi director chris wray has issued ,  to prevent the problems from recurring., but the page aspect of the probe accounted for only a fraction of it, and the dossier — though the target of much derision — had nothing to do with the decision to open the investigation. the page problems don’t relate to the criminal convictions that mueller’s team produced against six trump associates, or the 25 russians indicted on charges related to election interference., how are republicans weaponizing it?, in an extraordinary mix of politics in america’s national security apparatus, trump has demanded that intelligence and justice department officials act to discredit the russia investigation before the nov. 3 election. to a large extent, they’ve complied., much of the declassified material involves page and the dossier. but they’ve also released information that, while creating buzz in conservative media, offer scant evidence of wrongdoing., officials declassified the names of obama administration officials ,  of an american — in this case, former national security adviser michael flynn — who surveillance revealed had interacted with russia’s ambassador, but who wasn’t identified by name in intelligence reports. while trump cast the unmasking as sinister, it’s a routine action and proper procedures were followed. , the washington post reported tuesday that a probe commissioned by barr and focused on the “unmasking” question had concluded without criminal charges or any findings of substantive wrongdoing., separately, some republican senators are seeking an inspector general investigation after records showed multiple members of mueller’s team had forgotten their work phone passcodes or entered the wrong ones too often, causing data to be lost. one of the prosecutors, andrew weissmann, has said in media interviews that the issue is overblown since the information was backed up., more recently, the national intelligence director, john ratcliffe, a trump loyalist, declassified what he said was russian intelligence analysis even though he acknowledged the information might not be accurate., meanwhile, attorney general william barr has appointed a prosecutor to investigate the origins of the russia probe. that prosecutor, u.s. attorney john durham of connecticut, has ,  from a former fbi lawyer for altering an email related to page’s surveillance., trump has demanded big-name indictments and called for the probe to be , . but it’s not clear when durham will finish his work or what it will reveal., how is the russia probe figuring in the presidential campaign?, even before it was released, the mueller report was seen as potentially devastating to trump, with its details about campaign ties to russia and the president’s efforts to hinder the probe. yet democrats have hardly mentioned it. leading in the polls, democratic nominee joe biden has focused instead on trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the divisiveness of his presidency, issues that may be more likely to resonate with voters., meanwhile, attacking the russia probe is a core part of trump’s campaign. trump and his supporters have often mischaracterized the investigation, with trump falsely claiming that president barack obama spied on his campaign. vice president mike pence falsely suggested at a debate last week that the investigation had vindicated trump., those attacks on the russia probe may not win over many undecided voters. but they could energize trump’s base at a time when the campaign needs a strong turnout in crucial battleground states.][ moscow — russian president vladimir putin said thursday there is no need for a russia-china military alliance now, but noted it could be forged in the future.,  putin’s statement signaled deepening ties between moscow and beijing amid , . the russian leader also made a strong call for extending the last remaining arms control pact between moscow and washington.,  asked during a video conference with international foreign policy experts thursday whether a military union between moscow and beijing was possible, putin replied that “we don’t need it, but, theoretically, it’s quite possible to imagine it.”, russia will perceive any ballistic missile launched at its territory as a nuclear attack that warrants a nuclear retaliation, the military warned in an article published friday.,  russia and china have hailed their “strategic partnership,” but so far rejected any talk about the possibility of their forming a military alliance., \" putin pointed to the war games that the armed forces of china and russia held as a signal of the countries burgeoning military cooperation.\",  putin also noted that russia has shared sensitive military technologies that helped significantly boost china’s military potential, but didn’t mention any specifics, saying the information was sensitive.,  “without any doubt, our cooperation with china is bolstering the defense

accusations of russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and other rifts., a host of scenarios could push china and the united states into some kind of conflict.,  putin on thursday emphasized the importance of extending , that expires in february, russia’s last arms control pact with the united states.,  earlier this week, the united states and russia signaled their readiness to accept compromises to salvage the new start treaty just two weeks ahead of the u.s. presidential election in which president donald trump faces a strong challenge from former vice president joe biden, whose campaign has accused trump of being soft on russia.,  new start was signed in 2010 by then-u.s. president barack obama and then-russian president dmitry medvedev. the pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.,  russia had offered to extend the pact without any conditions, while the trump administration initially insisted that it could only be renewed if china agreed to join. china has refused to consider the idea. the u.s. recently modified its stance and proposed a one-year extension of the treaty, but said it must be coupled with the imposition of a broader cap on nuclear warheads.,  the kremlin initially resisted washington’s demand, but its position shifted this week with the russian foreign ministry stating that moscow can accept a freeze on warheads if the u.s. agrees to put forward no additional demands.,  putin didn’t address the issue of the freeze on warheads, but he emphasized the importance of salvaging new start.,  “the question is whether to keep the existing treaty as it is, begin a detailed discussion and try to reach a compromise in a year or lose that treaty altogether, leaving ourselves, russia and the united states, along with the rest of the world, without any agreement restricting an arms race,” he said. “i believe the second option is much worse.”,  at the same time, he added that russia “wasn’t clinging to the treaty” and will ensure its security without it. he pointed at ,  and indicated a readiness to include them in a future pact.,  “if our partners decide that they don’t need it, well, so be it, we can’t stop them,” he said. “russia’s security will not be hurt, particularly because we have the most advanced weapons systems.”, \"the successful test launch of the zircon hypersonic cruise missile comes on vladimir putins birthday.\",  despite indications earlier this week that russia and the u.s. were inching closer to a deal on new start, the top russian negotiator said that “dramatic” differences still remain and strongly warned washington against making new demands.,  sergei ryabkov cautioned the u.s. against pressing its demand for more intrusive control verification measures like those that existed in the 1990s and aren’t envisaged by the new start. the diplomat argued that new control mechanisms could be discussed as part of a future deal, saying firmly that russia will not accept the demand that amounts to “legitimate espionage.”,  “if it doesn’t suit the u.s. for some reason, then there will be no deal,” ryabkov was quoted by the interfax news agency as saying.][for travel to the united states on a temporary basis, including tourism, temporary employment, study and

so, mr. ambassador, as you mentioned, the time for the last months was unusual, so many frustration for people, so many bad news. and culture has always been a good retreat for people to boost up their energy, morale, spirits, and everything. so i’m very happy to talk to you about cultural positive aspects of your activities and russian-american relations. so please tell us about the initiative regarding the hermitage foundation and hermitage state museum.,  well, thank you, konstantin. it’s a pleasure to be talking about something is as exciting and as important as this program. i have to say we were [talking] at the outset about how covid has impacted the world since we last saw each other at the beginning of this year in january. among other things, it’s prevented me from going to st. petersburg in my first 10 or 11 months as ambassador, which i was looking forward to. i haven’t been there since 1988. and i was looking forward to visiting the hermitage, among other things., so you’ve referenced this grant that we’ve made through the ambassadors fund for cultural preservation to support the hermitage. and i can give you a little bit a little bit of detail on that. the project is actually a partnership among four organizations. there’s this ambassador’s fund for cultural preservation, which is part of the state department’s bureau of educational and cultural affairs. that’s one. and then there’s our role at the u.s. embassy. and you mentioned the hermitage foundation, which is based in new york city. and then finally, there’s the state hermitage museum in st. petersburg. and among all four of these, these organizations, we came together to come up with a project to restore three frescoes of the raphael school as part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the death of raphael., and that’s what we’re focused on. these frescoes were painted between 1523 and 1524, on the wall of a villa in italy, and they were actually acquired by the hermitage in 1860. but over the past 500 years, the frescoes have suffered considerable exposure to the elements and prior restoration efforts were imperfect. so the program that we’re sponsoring, is to restore those frescoes which is urgently needed. and as i say it’s done in connection with the 500th anniversary of raphael’s death. and we’re hopeful that after they’re restored, that there will be really an unveiling of the true beauty of the frescoes not just to the russian public, but to the world. which is, you know, the hermitage museum is, of course, a cultural treasure of russia, but really, of the world. i mean, the hermitage is such a – literally – a treasure of art and culture., so with this grant we’re doing, the program is done – we’ve been working with the executive director of the hermitage foundation and i want to credit her, saranna biel-cohen [working] on behalf of the foundation, and of course the director of the hermitage museum, mikhail piotrovsky. i want to credit them for their hard work on this project. and next week on october 28, the foundation, the museum, and myself, the embassy, will have a virtual launch of the project, and anybody, any of your readers or you, if you’re interested, it’ll be at 5pm on wednesday, the 28th. and we’ll learn more about the frescoes, how they’ll be restored, and the cultural significance.,  very good. and could you say a couple of words about this ambassador’s fund for cultural preservation? as i understand it is a deliberate foundation to preserve treasures cultural treasures throughout the world.,  yes, indeed, it was established, [nineteen] years ago [in 2001]. it’s a program that’s operated in over 100 countries. and it’s managed out of the state department in washington. and there is a process to review proposals and get approval from the department of state to provide the funding. so this program that we submitted on behalf of the hermitage foundation and the hermitage, was in a competition against hundreds of other proposals from other u.s. embassies worldwide. and the fact that this project won this grant is a sign both of the significance of the project itself, and of the cultural partnership between the united states and russia. and this will be i think, the [seventh] project that we have funded in russia over the last 20 years or so. so it’s an important sign of the cultural bonds between the united states and russia,  very good. you’re lucky that you prepared the good papers. and we are lucky, of course, russians that this will be restored. and may i ask you some questions about other cultural people to people, so to say, relations between russia and america, like sisters cities program, or the u.s.-russia business cooperation, or cooperation in space, arctic, because there are a lot of dimensions of coexistence, rather only all the military and strategic ones.,  well, konstantin, you’re absolutely right. and i would say, you know, there are relations between the u.s. government and the government of the russian federation, whether it’s on strategic and military issues, political issues, and we all know how fraught those relations have been over the last several years in particular. but there’s a much broader relationship between the united states and russia between our peoples, including cultural and educational exchanges, in business, in space, in the arctic, and a small topic that i like to emphasize, but my colleagues here at the embassy are probably sick of hearing me talk about – ice hockey – which is a personal interest of mine. but it’s those connections, i think, konstantin that are among the most significant that we have. and they are a bond that keeps us together, when the political situation seems most dire. and one thing i’ve observed in my tenure here is how much the relationship between the united states and russia has changed, just in my professional lifetime., you know, i came i mentioned earlier in our conversation that i visited st. petersburg in 1988. i was a private u.s. citizen had a great interest in russia and russian history. i visited moscow, what was then leningrad, but i visited the soviet union then, and i visited leningrad, not st. petersburg. and if you think of all that’s happened in our relationship between our two countries over the last 30 to 35 years, how things have changed, the ups and downs, what’s grown has been the cultural, business, all of those ties between our two peoples that have grown dramatically., and that distinguishes this era, from that sort of late soviet era that i grew up in, in the 70s and 80s, when we didn’t have those many ties that keep us together, when the political sea gets choppy. so now, for example, we have more than 1,000 u.s. businesses invested in doing business here in russia. and that means russians and americans working together. it’s not just the bolshoi traveling to new york and performing in new york city, or, you know, an equivalent theatre company coming from the united states and performing here. it is day to day personal interaction between colleagues in business. and that’s significant. and it provides a little more ballast for the relationship, when, as i say, the political seas, can get choppy., but as those of us who are old enough, with some perspective, can look back over the last three or four decades and see how our relationship has changed. our counterparts 20 or 30 years from now, the u.s. ambassador and your successor, you know, i’m sure they’ll be remarking too on how much things have changed since 2020. and the relationship between the united states and russia remember those dark old days with, you know, with ukraine – crimea – and syria, and libya, and nagorno-karabakh, and belarus, and election interference and cyber this – and god knows what our successors are going to be talking about 35 years from now. but what i will say is, the fact that we have made the connections that we’ve made over the last 30 or 35 years in business, in the arts, in sports and entertainment, will make it more likely that it’s a positive outcome and more positive developments. not just focused on the day to day negativity.,  yeah, you mentioned the amazing figure that a thousand u.s. businesses are dealing with russia, despite all the sanctions and all the risks connected with sanctions. and our cooperation between military in syria also exist and they exchange information. so i really share your view that the infrastructure of many, many spheres of interrelations is a good support to these big politics.,  and part of that, you’re absolutely right, a part of that infrastructure is something you mentioned, konstantin – sister city partnerships. we’ve got a large number. this is a program that’s been in existence for decades, established by and managed by the u.s. government. so there’s an official u.s. government relationship that’s involved here., [note: sister cities international is a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) nonprofit which serves as the national membership organization for individual sister cities, counties, and states across the united states. sister cities international was created at president eisenhower’s 1956 white house summit on citizen diplomacy. but it is an independent, nongovernmental organization. end note.], but these sister city relationships, you know, date back into soviet times, into the 1970s when i think the first five sister city relationships happened. and now, you know, we’ve got cities all across the united states that are joined with cities across russia, so sarasota, florida and vladimir, for example. burlington, vermont and yaroslavl, louisville, kentucky and perm, chicago and moscow. and it’s, you know, it’s a small thing, but it’s an important part of our relationship. and, i’d also make the link with business as well, konstantin, because what we’ve done here at the embassy, and my colleagues at the u.s. department of commerce, and our counterparts at the ministry of trade, is that we have made connections, business-to-business connections, with regions and cities in the united states., because of covid, we had to do this virtually, but we were planning a trade mission from texas – texas companies and the government of the state of texas – to the yekaterinburg in the ural region. we had to do it because of covid, we did it virtually, but it was a full day event. the government of the state of texas was involved, the governor of the state himself. and making those types of regional connections for business, i think is a is a profitable way forward. and i’ve spoken to secretary ross, our secretary of commerce, about this. and i know that the secretary himself had a phone call recently with trade minister manturov. and that’s an area where we’re going to continue to pursue making those connections regionally, as well, not just government-to-government.,  very important, because a lot of asymmetric information is available in regions. people wants to do something, but they lack adequate information. so thank you for that effort in yekaterinburg, because it’s our industrial, i think, number three or number four, city in russian. do you have any plans for cooperation in the arctic because arctic seems to attract attention.,  yes, it’s a very relevant and timely topic in our relationship, konstantin, because, as you know, russia will take over the chair of the arctic council in just a few months in 2021. and the arctic council is a very important institution that promotes this vital region, as a zone of cooperation free from conflict. and the council itself is an institution where we can discuss sustainable development, the environment, protection and development of indigenous peoples. and it’s a shared interest of the united states, russia – russia, of course, has a huge chunk of the arctic region within its northern border – but the united states, canada, the other members of the countries that border the arctic region, we all have a shared interest in its development and its protection. and so my colleagues in washington and our embassy here have been engaged directly with the russian government, with the ministry of foreign affairs in particular. i met with first deputy foreign minister titov a couple of months ago, to talk about arctic cooperation and russia’s role assuming the chair of the arctic council. and those discussions have continued between our two governments, between washington and moscow, and the pace of interaction will increase as we get closer to 2021 when russia does assume the chair., okay, thank you. and the last question, but our younger audience is always interested about student exchange. and now with covid, a lot of zoom classes may have. but still, what is number of russians which are enrolled in american universities and colleges?, well, terrific question. and i could guess, off the top of my head, but what i’m going to propose is that we get back to you with the precise figures for your publication., [note: the latest open doors report shows that for the 2018-2019 academic year, more than 5,000 russians studied in the us. we do not have the figures for current enrollment in online programs. end note.], but what i would offer, konstantin, is we had – i participated in a virtual program, that the united states government, that we the embassy helped organize. we usually do it in person, we bring over representatives from colleges and universities in the united states. and they come here to russia, to moscow to other cities, and they’re available to russian families, russian students, parents, who are interested in having a student study in the united states. because of covid, we weren’t able to do that in person. we did it virtually., but here’s the benefit, though, of that, if there’s a silver lining, we got many more u.s. colleges and universities able to participate virtually, who wouldn’t have been able to, to send either afford to or couldn’t send somebody, to participate in a program in in moscow. so what that meant was that the russian students and their families that were interested and participated got a wide variety of much wider variety of u.s. colleges and universities presented and interested in recruiting them to study in the united states. and i know you yourself studied at penn. i won’t embarrass you by saying how many years ago it was, but i was long out of college myself by then. so we’re, neither of us is a youngster anymore. but you yourself can testify to the benefit of study abroad, and getting to know another country, and seeing how their education system works., and i know a number of my colleagues here at the embassy, have studied at russian institutions, russian language, russian culture. so it’s a key component, and has been for a long time, and we’re really looking to, to encourage that. and it’s always fun to meet russians who have studied in the united states and compare notes about their experience, with our expectations. i will say, and these were, these were my remarks, and i wasn’t just trying to flatter the russian participants. it’s a fact that we hear from us colleges and universities, that russian students are among the most desired, are the most serious, hardworking, and just great additions to the student body, which isn’t this surprise for those of us who know or aspire to know, to know russia. it’s an important part of our relationship, the broader relationship between our two peoples. and we certainly want to encourage it, and we’re doing all we can, in the face of the covid pandemic, to make sure that those relationships continue, and that they don’t wither or diminish just because we’re not able to have in person interaction. so my hope is that we’ll have a large number of russian students traveling to the united states and enriching our schools and our campuses as you did in the 80s in philadelphia., \\\\xa0thank you. and i, personally, i am very grateful to you for supporting this students’ exchange. because, you know, if you live in the country, it is so difficult to influence you, in pushing any misperceptions, [to engage you in a] witch hunt. and it helps to understand the nature of people. and since 33 years ago, i returned back from philadelphia. you know, i keep this interest towards america i read every day american papers, i read american books, i watch american television, i watched the debate. \\\\xa0tonight i put down notes, who said what, what is the argument of that., and this is something very profound in our sympathy and relations and desire to improve it. because i belong to that part of russian society, and i always openly said at every level that we believe that good relations with america can benefit russian people in medicine, in science, in culture, in sports, in engineering, in business, benefit it. it could be rather selfish from this point of view, but it is beneficial. it’s not hostile. and i wish that you in your position of ambassador put all your efforts, pursue the line in these dark, dark days of covid and the distraction of regular relationships.,  oh, you’re so right. and i had a great experience a few months ago now. and i can add to all of the categories you listed, law and the legal profession. so i spoke to law students. it was probably a couple of hundred. it was a virtual, a virtual event i did it by zoom or some other electronic means which my colleagues are much better able to describe and make function than i. i just sit in front of the camera and talk. but what was fascinating was, for many of those students, i was the first american that they really had a chance to engage with in their young lives. and we had a lot in common. we talked about our legal education. some of their professors were on the call. and we got to share a few comments about law professors, and what it was like joining a profession, what their expectations were. and it’s just an example in our lives. i know we’ve both experienced this., russians and americans, there are so many things that we have in common, whether we’re engineers, or ballet dancers, or hockey players, or authors, or lawyers. people are people, and the more that we can have these exchanges, trade experiences, explore how our systems are different and how they’re similar. it breaks down stereotypes, and it just makes things between our two countries, makes the relationship stronger, and makes it more difficult for political winds to blow the relationship in a really dangerous direction. the more we understand each other, the better we’ll be able to overcome some of these differences which would separate us now., yeah, thank you, mr. ambassador. do you know what i noticed that what you talked today was actually about the substance of russian-american relations, because usually, a lot of experts view the need of russia to america and vice versa only as a means to solve some others country’s problems, like, we need russia to solve problem in north korea, or in iran, or in afghanistan, or it’s here, but it’s never a table which belongs to us. all spheres, which you mentioned, just belong to russia, and america, in every aspect. and i think it is most valuable in this relation that we have the body of mutual interest. and thank you for understanding that and pursuing this line., well, you’re so right. and it’s not to diminish the importance of those geopolitical issues which i spend, you know, the vast amount of my time focused on and i know you write about, and we’re all interested in, and they’re extremely important to the world and global security and peace and prosperity. but if we’re talking about the united states and russia, it’s not just those issues. and our relationship has a long history. i was joking with the first deputy foreign minister titov, we were we were talking about the arctic. and i commented on the fact that i have to thank russia, then the russian empire, for giving the united states a stake in the arctic by selling us alaska. right?, so our relationship goes back a long, long way to when secretary of state seward purchased alaska, and made us a part of eventually the arctic council. but we shared a laugh over that. but it just an example of over time, the united states and russia, we have to deal with each other on these political issues, but on a broader level, people to people, we have stronger ties now than we did when i was growing up in the 60s and 70s, and 80s. people to people ties, educational, and so forth. the political issues are as challenging and maybe even more challenging in some ways than they were for my predecessors 40 or 50 years ago when it was the soviet union versus the west and the united states. but in any event, as long as we keep talking about positive things like this, it will give us more space to try to work out the more difficult political issues as well., thank you very much for this interview and looking forward to talk with you on some other issues, maybe later, because there were a lot of substantial things you conveyed.\\\\xa0 it’s very important for our people, because they’re asymmetrically informed about the positions because they don’t understand how profound is your access to your job and your mission as ambassador here., well, thank you, konstantin. i look forward to continuing this conversation, i hope in person soon but if not, continuing through zoom. so look forward to speaking again soon., end, by ,  | 26 october, 2020 | topics: , , , , , , , , , \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t][\\\\n, \\\\n, \\\\n, a soyuz booster and fregat upper stage successfully delivered an upgraded russian glonass navigation satellite to an orbit nearly 12,000 miles above earth on saturday., the new satellite joins 24 active navigation spacecraft in the glonass fleet, russia’s analog to the u.s. military’s global positioning system., the mission took off at 3:08:42 p.m. edt (1908:42 gmt) saturday aboard a russian soyuz-2.1b rocket from the plesetsk cosmodrome, a military-run launch base around 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of moscow, according to the russian ministry of defense., liftoff occurred at 10:08 p.m. moscow time., heading southeast from plesetsk, the soyuz rocket shed its four kerosene-fueled boosters around two minutes after liftoff, then jettisoned the aerodynamic shroud covering the glonass satellite after reaching space. the soyuz core stage shut down and separated around five minutes into the mission, followed by ignition of the third stage’s rd-0124 engine., the third stage engine cut off about nine minutes after liftoff, and the mission’s fregat upper stage deployed to begin a series of maneuvers to place the glonass satellite its targeted orbit., the fregat engine ignited three times to place the glonass payload into a circular orbit with\\\\xa0an altitude of more than 11,900 miles (19,100 kilometers) and an inclination of 64.8 degrees. the fregat upper stage released the glonass spacecraft around three-and-a-half hours after liftoff., russian officials said the glonass satellite extended its solar panels, and ground teams established contact with the spacecraft. all systems on-board the satellite were functioning normally after launch saturday, officials said., the payload launched saturday is the third spacecraft in russia’s glonass k series of navigation satellites, which engineers designed\\\\xa0to last longer and transmit more navigation signals. the first two glonass k satellites launched in 2011 and 2014., the glonass k satellites weigh around 2,060 pounds, or 935 kilograms, somewhat less than the earlier generation glonass m satellites., the glonass k satellite is expected to operate for 10 years — an improvement from the seven-year design life of previous satellites — and features five navigation channels, including a new civilian l-band signal. the new craft are lighter, generate more electrical power, and are based on an unpressurized express 1000k bus built by iss reshetnev\\\\xa0in\\\\xa0zheleznogorsk, russia., the glonass k spacecraft will also support the international cospas-sarsat search and rescue network, russian officials said., the satellite launched saturday also uses more russian-built equipment than previous glonass spacecraft, a change introduced to the glonass k design due to international sanctions on russia., “replacing the orbital constellation with glonass k spacecraft will ensure the stable operation of the russian navigation system and increase the accuracy of its navigation determinations up to tens of centimeters,” the russian defense ministry said in a statement., as of monday, the glonass fleet consists of 24 active satellites, plus the new spacecraft launched saturday, and three more operating as a spare, undergoing maintenance, and performing fight tests. the network, which is run by the russian military but also used by civilians worldwide, requires 24 satellites in service spread among three orbital planes to provide global navigation coverage., the russian ministry of defense was expected to name the new glonass satellite kosmos 2547, keeping with the naming scheme for russian military spacecraft.']"
