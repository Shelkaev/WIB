epoch creates the illusion that borscht is an inalienable part of the russian menu,” ms. syutkina said.', 'adding to the confusion, russians seeking to lay claim to borscht’s origins sometimes cite an entirely different soup that was made in medieval times in russia from wild hogweed grass and a light beer made from fermented bread. it, too, was called borscht, and is mentioned in a 16th-century moscow book of advice about home life, “homemaker.”', 'in rural ukraine, gardens yield all the ingredients. for the winter, ukrainians preserve sour sorrel leaves in canning jars as a base for green borscht, a version without beets. for funeral wakes, vegetarian borscht is on the menu.', 'more typically, it is a meaty broth, sometimes so rich a quarter inch or so of glistening, liquid fat shimmers on the surface.', 'in borshchiv recently, ms. habro made a pot for her son, who had been working in the garden planting garlic, and for her grandson, who had been at best only pretending to help with the garden chores but wasn’t begrudged a bowl of soup all the same.', 'a secret of borscht is accounting for the different cooking times of the ingredients, typically beetroot, carrots, beans, potatoes and some sort of meat, usually beef, but sometimes pork or chicken. ms. habro uses two pots — the meat, beans and potatoes in one, the beets and carrots in the other — mixing the two just before serving.', 'last month russia seemed to back down — a rarity these days — on any claim of a direct sphere of influence over the soup. “borscht is a national food of many countries,

borscht,” by a division of the russian information agency, a state news outlet at times accused of influence operations. it was a version built on beef bouillon with potatoes, spiced with black pepper, which appeared tasty enough.', 'anton a. alyoshin, head chef at clever, a culinary school in moscow, said the more traditional russian soups use sauerkraut rather than fresh cabbage, reflecting the tradition of preserving vegetables for the long, harsh northern winters. the result is a delightful pork and sauerkraut soup — shchi — that is more indisputably russia’s own. it is also served with sour cream, but, sadly, is not well-known outside russia.', '“by the culinary canon, borscht is a ukrainian tradition,” mr. alyoshin said, surrendering without a fight. “if we talk about

south caucasus have been constant, but its capabilities to project power and influence have fluctuated.', ' russia’s engagement with the entire caucasus region is best characterized as a tide. its power and influence began to ebb at the start of the karabakh conflict—with the february 1988 massacre of armenians in the azerbaijani city of sumqayit being the key galvanizing event.', ' after that, the tide receded rapidly, leaving even russian possessions in the north caucasus without effective central control. the first chechen war marked low tide, which only began to rise with the second chechen war, beginning in 1999. until about 2004, russia was too weak and internally divided to project power and influence in the wider caucasus region in a meaningful way.', 'to be sure, russian influence was never gone completely, even during the lowest ebb of the tide. russia still marshaled greater resources than the new states of the caucasus could muster, and it threw its weight around. but in the 1990s, russia did not have a unified governing apparatus, but rather a mass of competing clans among which regional actors could maneuver. for example, after the soviet collapse, moscow left the russian military units in the caucasus to their own devices. those units served as mercenaries, arms suppliers, and logistics providers to both sides in the karabakh conflict. it took a decade for moscow to reassert its so-called power vertical in the caucasus, symbolized by president vladimir putin’s success in 2004 in finally ousting chief of the general staff anatoliy kvashnin.', ' russia’s assertiveness in the region grew steadily thereafter, with sharp upticks after the 2008 war with georgia and putin’s return to the presidency in 2012.', 'but while moscow has gained the capacity to project more power and influence, the regional landscape has changed. the surge in fighting over nagornyy karabakh that began in late september 2020 has demonstrated that russia is struggling to contend with a vastly more complicated landscape. more external actors are on the scene, most notably turkey, and all three south caucasus states—armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia—have adapted their strategies to deal with the new environment. russia’s increased efforts have had decidedly mixed results.', 'three factors were evident when the soviet union collapsed and continue today, narrowing russian policy options in the region.', 'armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia are all radically different, with varying attitudes toward russia and moscow’s rule throughout the imperial and soviet eras. for centuries, armenia has sought russia’s protection against turkey and iran, which ruled most of the armenian historic homelands.', ' this security concern was paramount in the immediate aftermath of the soviet collapse: the soviet army had disappeared, leaving the turkish third army as the most potent military force in the wider region. for its part, post-soviet russia views armenia as its closest friend in the region. a large and influential armenian diaspora in russia has maintained those positive feelings.', 'azerbaijani elites, russified by the oil boom of the late nineteenth century, have largely been friendly to russia. thanks to former president heydar aliyev—who rose through the ranks of the soviet kgb and neither feared nor hated the post-soviet rulers of russia—a generally positive attitude toward russia survived the nationalisms of the years immediately following the soviet collapse. though post-soviet russia was initially suspicious of the expansion of turkish and western influence in azerbaijan, russia has since forged close energy relations with turkey. in the early period, these commercial relations took precedence in the russia-turkey relationship. more recently, as detailed later in the paper, the increasing ambiguity of russian-turkish relations has complicated russia’s relations with azerbaijan.', 'armenia and azerbaijan have incorporated friendly relations with russia into a wider strategy: former armenian foreign minister vartan oskanian described it as a multivectoral approach, in which “foreign policy vectors point in different directions.”', ' it entails seeking close relations with and assistance from powers other than russia, primarily the united states and the european union (eu). large armenian diasporas in the united states and france have aided this endeavor. in contrast, a poor record on democracy and human rights, as well as the armenian diaspora’s efforts in the united states, have hobbled azerbaijan. in the united states, congressional legislation blocked most assistance to azerbaijan until waiver authority was granted in 2001 in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks and azerbaijan’s subsequent role in assisting u.s. antiterrorism efforts elsewhere.', 'in georgia, nationalism remains centered on the rejection of russia. since the massacre of unarmed civilians by soviet troops in the capital, tbilisi, in 1989 and the post-independence presidency of former soviet dissident—and extreme nationalist—zviad gamsakhurdia, georgian society has generally come to view russia as a usurping occupier. february 25—the day the red army invaded tbilisi in 1921—is still observed annually as soviet occupation day. georgians explain away decades of fawning over the “occupiers” as one ambassador did: “for all those years that the russians ruled us, we told them we loved them. and they actually believed us.” georgian warlords deposed gamsakhurdia in january 1992 and installed former soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze as a weak figurehead. his tenure as president involved a constant renegotiation of his powers to gain ascendancy over those warlords. in the early 1990s, still at his weakest vis-à-vis the warlords and pressured by russian support for abkhaz and ossetian separatism, he tried to harness, not reverse, the extreme nationalism of his predecessor’s supporters, especially those displaced from abkhazia by russian-backed separatists.', 'for their part, russians have acted as emotionally as the georgians, seeing georgia’s aspirations toward the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) and the eu as the betrayal of its once advantageous position within moscow’s empire. during one regularly occurring period of heightened tensions, a normally calm senior russian diplomat asked, “when the soviet union was ruled by people named jughashvili, orjonikidze, and beria, just who was occupying whom?” after the september 11, 2001, attacks, as u.s. troops were arriving in georgia to train georgians in counterterrorism, an embittered russian general, recalling the old times of russian officers’ warm reception in georgia over countless song-and-wine-filled ', ' banquets, said, “the americans think they will teach the georgians to fight. in reality, the georgians will teach the americans to sing.”', 'russia cannot deal with armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia in isolation because the countries’ own relations with one another are dense and fraught with tension and conflict. most salient is the karabakh conflict, over which armenians and azerbaijanis have shed so much blood since 1987. both sides appeal to russia for support and view russian amity toward the other side as a betrayal. in the early years, russia tried to profit from the conflict, clandestinely providing weaponry and mercenaries to both sides. in 1992 and 1993, russians backed two coups to install puppets in azerbaijan, but both backfired. in 1992, former azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov’s attempt to return from moscow was thwarted by the nationalist azerbaijan popular front. and in 1993, surat huseynov’s revolt against the popular front was hijacked by aliyev, who took power for himself alone.', ' thereafter, russia stepped back in the region. since brokering a ceasefire in the karabakh conflict in 1994, moscow has limited its interventions to trying (unsuccessfully) to get the sides to agree to a russia-led peacekeeping force of the sort moscow installed to control the abkhazia, south ossetia, and transdniestria separatist conflicts. russia remains a supplier of weaponry to both sides, and every major arms sale to one provokes protests from the other. because azerbaijan’s oil revenues expanded, it has been able to diversify its defense procurements, but armenia remains dependent on russia for arms and security guarantees.', 'georgia is closely intertwined with both armenia and azerbaijan. there are large armenian and azerbaijani minorities in georgia (in separatist abkhazia, armenians actually outnumber the abkhaz). despite initial nationalist difficulties in borchaly, an azerbaijani-inhabited section of georgia, georgian-azerbaijani relations have been good almost since georgia’s independence—largely thanks to a reconciliation of convenience between two soviet-era rivals, eduard shevardnadze and heydar aliyev. aliyev needed georgia to enable the western transit of azerbaijan’s hydrocarbon exports and the import of western goods from turkey. shevardnadze needed azerbaijan to secure oil and gas pipelines to provide both transit royalties and strategic importance to the west.', ' he also needed aliyev to help ensure that the large azerbaijani population of georgia reliably voted for shevardnadze’s political grouping, the citizens union.', 'georgian-armenian relations have been trickier. a portion of the armenian population in georgia is concentrated in javakheti, near a large soviet (later russian) military base that fueled the region’s economy until it was closed in 2007. from 1992 to 1993, the javakhk armenians sought independence, apparently with russian encouragement. but armenia’s only transit routes to russia and the west lay through georgia, as the karabakh conflict had closed armenia’s borders with turkey and azerbaijan, so the government of then armenian president levon ter-petrosyan tamped down javakhk separatism. relations between the two countries grew closer after mikheil saakashvili came to the presidency in georgia in 2004, and they have remained friendly under subsequent leaders.', 'to this day, russian policy in the south caucasus is intertwined with the north caucasus—to which russia has devoted the blood and treasure of generations and which post-soviet russia sees as key to the integrity of the russian state. russia’s domestic security concerns have intruded on the south caucasus in a number of areas.', 'as russian power ebbed away at the end of the soviet era, the russian army—for the first time in centuries—no longer wielded the decisive force in the region. the turkish third army was the most powerful military in the region, and locals adapted to the strategic effects. russia threw its diminished resources into the caucasus to suppress the first chechen rebellion—and met defeat. russia’s subsequent remilitarization of the region, and its demands to adapt the conventional armed forces in europe treaty to allow for greater freedom of movement in the flank, stemmed from its perceived need to redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence in the region.', ' to address russia’s moves to adapt the treaty, azerbaijan and georgia allied with moldova and ukraine to form what later solidified into the organization for democracy and economic development (known simply as the guam).', 'ossetians, ethno-linguistically and religiously different from their neighbors, have been russia’s principal allies in the north caucasus for two centuries. as russia dealt with a host of ethnic nationalisms in the first years after the soviet collapse, including chechen separatism and later an armed islamist movement, north ossetia gained strategic importance to, and leverage with, russian leadership. it has used that leverage to ensure robust russian support for south ossetian separatism from georgia.', 'likewise, other ethnic groups in the mountains of the north caucasus (for example, the chechens, kabardians, and cherkes) saw in abkhaz separatism from georgia the validation of their own ethnic nationalisms. with russian facilitation, many so-called volunteers made their way to abkhazia to join the separatist war against georgia from 1992 to 1993. among the most effective of these was the chechen shamil basayev, who was later an archnemesis of the russians but their ally in that struggle.', 'during the second chechen war, fighters and their families took refuge in georgia’s pankisi gorge, which was effectively outside the georgian government’s control. russian president boris yeltsin called shevardnadze in november 1999 to demand the reinstatement of russian border troops in georgia and passage for russian military units through georgia to attack pankisi from the south. shevardnadze stalled and then called on the americans to dissuade yeltsin. later, after the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the united states sent troops to train the georgians to restore security in pankisi, forestalling russian actions there. even worse, from the russian point of view, shevardnadze made a deal with ruslan gelayev, a chechen commander sheltering in the pankisi gorge, to launch an attack on abkhaz-held territory in 2001. the attack failed, but the russian authorities viewed this series of events as proof that georgia was treacherous and untrustworthy.', 'lastly, azerbaijan shares a long border and considerable ethnic overlap with russia’s dagestan autonomous republic, where salafist proselytizing made extensive inroads in the 1990s. after some years, a full-fledged islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked up with the remains of the armed chechen nationalist movement, which also fell under salafist influence. when attacks began on authorities in dagestan, security cooperation with azerbaijan gained importance for russian internal security.', 'the stage was thus set early on for a consistent—even static—russian policy toward the south caucasus: an economy-of-force balancing act to preserve russia’s traditional friendship and strategic alliance with armenia without harming russia’s economic and security relationship with azerbaijan; and a constant, emotional, and ever-deepening hostility toward georgia.', 'russia views the international arena as a series of camps, each centered by a power whose greatness is confirmed by possessing a camp.', ' russia has been keen to ensure that the new nations forged out of former soviet republics remain in its camp and has formed multinational institutions to cement those relations.', 'initially, russia had hopes that the commonwealth of independent states (cis), formed when the soviet union broke up, might fill the bill. azerbaijan and armenia joined the cis at its inception in 1991. but it was not until 1993 that georgia’s president shevardnadze—under russian military pressure in support of abkhaz separatism and facing a rebellion by ousted former president gamsakhurdia—reluctantly acceded. in 2008, georgia withdrew from the cis after the country’s defeat in the russo-georgian war. with the cis having little influence, russia put forward two other institutions to accomplish the task.', 'the collective security treaty, originally signed in 1992, became the collective security treaty organization (csto) in 2002, designed as a counterweight to nato. armenia joined to relieve its security concerns with regard to turkey; azerbaijan and georgia did not.', 'the eurasian customs union, officially formed in 2000 but active from 2010 onward, also included armenia but not azerbaijan or georgia. in 2014, russia turned the customs union into the eurasian economic union (eaeu), intended as a mirror image of the eu. moscow’s ongoing attempts to equate the two organizations on the international stage has had significant effects on the caucasus, as noted later in this paper.', 'azerbaijan was able to avoid joining russia’s so-called camp thanks to its independent oil revenues, which have grown for both azerbaijan and other post-soviet caspian littoral states. in the early 1990s, moscow’s ability to project power was low and russia could only protest ineffectually when littoral countries signed hydrocarbon extraction contracts in the absence of an international agreement to define national rights in the caspian.', ' azerbaijan, kazakhstan, and turkmenistan brought in western energy majors without fearing russia’s reaction (azerbaijan signed its first major contract in 1993). the status of the caspian was not codified even preliminarily until 2018, and to this day, no treaty covers exploitation of the seabed.', ' russia could not fight ’em, so it joined ’em, settling for sharing in the profits from hydrocarbon development and transit.', 'for a time in the mid-1990s, the united states and russia maneuvered against one another through their respective support of pipelines. the united states heavily promoted the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc) pipeline as an alternative to a russian monopoly on hydrocarbon transit to the west. however, u.s. doctrine demanded that the pipeline be commercially viable in its own right, and the united states refused to put resources into boosting that viability. recognizing this, russia banked on the oil majors’ desire to save money by transporting the oil by tanker across the black sea and through the turkish straits. but when then bp chair john browne visited istanbul and inspected the narrow bosphorus passage, he decided the route was too risky and threw the weight of the oil majors behind btc.', 'russia’s closest relationship in the south caucasus remains with armenia, the country most firmly entrenched in russia’s camp. it is frequently called a strategic alliance, and for armenia this is certainly the case as 3,000 russian troops based in its second-largest city, gyumri, form a trip wire against turkish military action.', 'while azerbaijan generally deals with other countries transactionally, another criterion takes precedence: their stance on armenia and the karabakh conflict. this is the trickiest situation for russia to manage: azerbaijan is russia’s largest trading partner in the caucasus, the two countries have important common issues regarding hydrocarbons, and russia sees a strategic aim in keeping azerbaijan out of what it calls the western camp. therefore, while supporting armenia, russia has tried to avoid alienating azerbaijan, including during the recent surge in fighting. until 2010, russia was discreet about its arms sales to armenia to avoid provoking azerbaijan, denying reports of large arms transfers when they surfaced in 2009.', ' more recently, russia has started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry to both sides and has been more open about its balancing. for example, in 2010, russia signed a new lease on its military base in gyumri (extending it to 2044) and agreed to sell s-300 surface-to-air missiles to azerbaijan.', 'as part of this balancing, russia is involved in attempts to mediate between azerbaijan and armenia to resolve the karabakh conflict. since 1995, russia has been a co-chair of the minsk group, a body under the aegis of the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce) and composed of a number of countries interested in brokering peace. in 1997, the united states and france joined russia as co-chairs, and the three countries have conducted all negotiations thereafter without significant input from the other group members. this structure has facilitated russia-west cooperation to keep a politically insoluble problem from flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline states. when dmitry medvedev was president of russia (2008–2012), he poured great efforts into russian peace initiatives, and with french and u.s. assent russia came to dominate the process. as part of this campaign, medvedev also supported the 2008 opening between armenia and turkey, azerbaijan’s closest ally. that rapprochement failed, however, due to opposition from key constituencies on both sides. ultimately, azerbaijan and armenia were not interested in a negotiated solution, and medvedev’s initiative foundered.', 'russia’s relations with georgia quickly went into a downward spiral after the soviet collapse. russia used substantial military force to ensure the survival and then victory of the separatist rebellion in abkhazia and leveraged that and a revolt by gamsakhurdia to force shevardnadze to accept a russian peacekeeping force in western georgia. still hostile, russia backed two attempts, in 1995 and 1998, to assassinate shevardnadze. until the latter attempt, shevardnadze had been trying to play russia and the united states off against each other, but these actions drove shevardnadze squarely into the arms of the united states.', 'the russians loathed shevardnadze for his role in the collapse of the soviet bloc—on one television program, he was reviled as “the ostap bender of the soviet union,” after the con-man protagonist of the classic soviet comic novel ', '. but that feeling paled beside the emotions stoked in the russian leadership by the flamboyant and mercurial mikheil saakashvili, who ousted shevardnadze at the end of 2003 and became president in 2004. in that year, saakashvili also ousted the quasi-independent aslan abashidze from his rule over the autonomous batumi region, which housed a russian military base. also in 2004, tensions flared in south ossetia. russia retaliated over the next few years, banning the import of georgian products, banning flights between russia and georgia, closing the land border between the two countries, and launching an aggressive campaign against ethnic georgians in russia, including russian citizens, their businesses, and their families. in 2007, russia closed off most of north ossetia to foreigners, allowing preparations for war to proceed unseen by the outside world. and in 2008, as tensions flared again in south ossetia, russian troops invaded, defeating georgia’s forces in short order, occupying parts of georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia, and incorporating these conquests into the separatist statelets, which russia shortly thererafter recognized as independent.', ' but the war also brought the expansion of a new competitor’s presence: the small, neutral osce mission was scrapped, and a large new eu monitoring mission was put in its place.', ' despite the limitations placed on that mission, the overall eu presence and commitment sharply increased.', 'putin’s return to the presidency in 2012 came with a more assertive foreign policy. new leaders wholly dependent on russia were installed in the separatist entities russia supported, including south ossetia and abkhazia, replacing long-established leaders who were pro-russian but possessed their own independent power bases. more importantly, russia began to treat the european union—not just nato—as a strategic rival intent on taking over parts of what medvedev had called russia’s sphere of “', '.” five years earlier, that view had been restricted to the ', ', or senior officers of the hard power ministries (primarily the military, internal affairs, and security services); after putin’s return to the presidency, it became russia’s official policy.', 'the ukrainian crisis of 2013–2014 began with putin pressuring both ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and armenian president serzh sargsyan into repudiating the eu association agreements they had signed and instead joining the nascent russia-centric eaeu. the pressure on sargsyan included a putin visit to azerbaijan’s capital, baku, to discuss arms sales. yanukovych’s caving to putin’s pressure triggered the revolution of dignity in ukraine and his eventual downfall. sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequences. he explained to the nation that security concerns necessitated joining the russian-led organization—that only russia could safeguard armenia from its neighbors. however, after rejecting the eu, sargsyan immediately tried to placate it. negotiations eventually restarted on a trade agreement, and in 2017, armenia signed a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with the eu.', 'after a few protests, armenians fell in line with sargsyan’s capitulation to putin’s wishes: they assumed their security expectations would be met and that this change was worth the economic disadvantages of giving up the association with the eu. indeed, when a few months later russia occupied crimea and annexed it after the fig leaf of a controlled referendum, armenians saw this as a model and justification for future annexation of nagornyy karabakh and the surrounding territories. russia’s actions had called into question all territorial dispositions after the soviet collapse, which had been agreed among the union republics, codified in the cis treaty, and endorsed by the international community. with borders now questioned and russia more capable of projecting power, it was better to be a close ally of russia than a potential victim.', 'but in april 2016, armenians suffered a rude awakening. on april 1, azerbaijan began a military operation along the line of contact in karabakh and, over the next four days, managed to regain a few strategic points occupied by the karabakh armenians years before. russia’s reaction was to maintain its balancing act. russian foreign minister sergey lavrov went to the region explicitly to be a neutral mediator. he brought a ceasefire plan and proposed the russian peacekeeping force that had been rejected so many years earlier. that approach did not go over well with the armenian populace. in their view, armenia was a treaty ally of russia and had given up european aspirations to stay in russia’s camp—and, therefore, russia should be on armenia’s side. however, as far as russia was concerned, legally, the combat had nothing to do with armenia but was between nagornyy karabakh and azerbaijan. the armenian people did not see it that way, after being convinced by their leaders over a generation that karabakh and armenia had become a single polity. sargsyan, who initially supported the idea of a russian peacekeeping force, was seen as having sold out armenian interests. he then had to backtrack, putting fatal cracks in his prestige and authority.', 'almost immediately, mutinies and demonstrations broke out, occasionally with a subtle anti-russian flavor. in july 2016, a group of gunmen calling themselves sasna tsrer (“daredevils of sassoun,” from an armenian epic poem) violently took over a police station and held out against government forces for two weeks, demanding sargsyan’s resignation. even after they surrendered, they retained widespread support, which translated into a people fed up with the ruling elite and with russia.', ' other factors—such as a notorious murder by a russian soldier, price hikes by the russian-owned electricity supplier, and continued arms sales to azerbaijan—further exacerbated popular discontent.', 'in 2017, faced with term limits when his presidency was to expire in 2018, sargsyan chose one of the standard post-soviet autocratic solutions to staying in power: establishing a parliamentary system, turning the presidency into a figurehead, and becoming prime minister. sargsyan and his dashnak nationalist allies duly won parliamentary elections in 2017, and a figurehead president was in due course elected in 2018. then the play went off script: the aggrieved populace rose up in demonstrations, and in just over a month, sargsyan was ousted. opposition leader nikol pashinyan was installed as acting prime minister, and new elections affirmed his position later in the year.', 'so far, this scenario resembles one of the “color revolutions” that putin had railed against for the previous fifteen years and had tried to reverse through military force in georgia, syria, and ukraine. but instead of condemning pashinyan (who had sharply criticized russia during the demonstrations) and lending full support to sargsyan (one of putin’s most loyal supporters), putin was remarkably restrained throughout and had a friendly and supportive meeting with pashinyan just days after the latter took power, publicly offering him his congratulations and best wishes.', 'it is possible that russia blamed sargsyan for the anti-russian sentiment following the clashes of april 2016.', ' but it is also clear that pashinyan made efforts to reassure putin, as he—like the entire armenian electorate—understood that russia remained the guarantor of armenia’s security vis-à-vis its much larger neighbors. he also understood that any rift with russia would create a vulnerability that azerbaijan could exploit with regard to karabakh; pashinyan knew he could not afford any daylight between armenia and russia. he left armenia in the eaeu and csto. he made clear that he would pursue a democratic system, but he “also said that he viewed democracy as a firm belief, rather than a geopolitical orientation, making clear the distinction.”', ' perhaps the fact that putin knew this as well, implying no major changes in armenia’s strategic orientation, occasioned his restraint: if there is no threat that armenia will leave its camp, russia can continue balancing its policy toward azerbaijan and armenia.', 'azerbaijan is the type of country with which putin seems to feel comfortable—a stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policies. azerbaijan causes few headaches for russia and demands only that its transactional approach be reciprocated. president ilham aliyev began his rule only three years after putin took over russia; his father heydar aliyev had ruled azerbaijan for a decade before that, not counting the soviet period, when he also ruled the country as his own fiefdom. heydar aliyev’s time in the senior-most ranks of the soviet state, communist party, and security services ', ' made his attitude very different from other post-soviet rulers, some of whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki in soviet times and saw moscow as the source of all power. heydar aliyev treated russia’s post-soviet rulers without the fealty or fear that some of his contemporaries showed.', 'ilham aliyev does not have the experience or ability of his father, but he has inherited that legacy of autonomous sovereignty. if pashinyan intends to show that democracy is a belief, not a geopolitical choice, the aliyevs have long since shown that the same is true of autocracy. azerbaijan and russia have enjoyed a functional, transactional relationship that is cordial, neighborly, and devoid of emotion. to some extent, azerbaijan grew ideologically closer to russia in the wake of the ukraine crisis, as both countries saw themselves as attacked and undermined by a fifth column of western-supported civil society and nongovernmental organizations. in 2014, the chief of azerbaijan’s presidential apparatus—usually considered closest to russia in the azerbaijani leadership—published a long, scathing article outlining that worldview. he even implied that charges of human rights violations against a country only proved that its leadership was defending its sovereignty.', 'but ideological sympathy never overcame azerbaijan’s transactional approach to relations with russia. in 2012, azerbaijan demanded a sharp increase in the rent russia was paying for the soviet-era qabala radar station. the station was part of the soviet and russian strategic early warning system, and therefore the united states favored its continued functioning to help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launches. nonetheless, azerbaijan stuck to its price demands, and the russians eventually closed the station at the end of 2012.', 'apart from its transactional approach, the azerbaijani leadership has a single prism for judging the actions of all other countries: the karabakh conflict. since independence, azerbaijan has rejected virtually all forms of multilateral cooperation involving armenia. that has imposed a durable limit on the extent of rapprochement with russia. for example, azerbaijan has not joined the csto, of which armenia is a member; to do so, it would have to renounce any military solution to the karabakh conflict, and it has been a tenet of faith in azerbaijan that only the credible threat of a military solution can pressure armenia to negotiate seriously. nor has azerbaijan joined the eaeu, as armenia did. joining it could limit azerbaijan’s ability to use its economic leverage to marshal international support on karabakh and counter armenian diaspora influence in the west, particularly in the united states and france.', 'indeed, because russia’s annexation of crimea calls into question the borders of the former soviet republics—which the republics recognize as state borders under the alma-ata declaration of december 21, 1991—it also calls into question the basis for azerbaijani claims to sovereignty over nagornyy karabakh. moreover, for the last fifteen years, proposed principles for a negotiated peace in the karabakh conflict have included a “binding expression of the popular will” as part of the ultimate disposition of the territory.', ' the russia-staged referendum in crimea drove home to the azerbaijanis how easy it is for the power with boots on the ground to ensure its desired outcome in such a vote.', 'all in all, since 2014, azerbaijan has become, if anything, even more transactional in its approach to russia. the 2016 offensive in karabakh, which might earlier have been deterred by reluctance to antagonize russia, can be seen as one example. the fighting azerbaijan initiated on september 27, 2020, can also be seen as a transaction with russia—one made possible by turkish intervention. to be sure, one aim of the offensive is to regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chips from armenia’s side of the board. but perhaps the larger aim is to threaten putin with instability and possibly a region-wide war if he does not force deep concessions on armenia. aliyev ignored lavrov’s initial offer: the return of two provinces, in exchange for russia being allowed to deploy a peacekeeping force.', ' whatever the outcome, it is clear that to azerbaijan, russia is now less of a partner and more of a problem to be solved.', 'azerbaijan tries to solve its russia problem through closer relations with, in particular, turkey and china. turkey has long been azerbaijan’s main advocate in the international sphere. aside from ethnic kinship (a significant azeri population lives in eastern turkey) and deep historical links before the soviet takeover, turkey is quick to cite certain protectorate rights granted under the treaties of moscow and kars (1921). since independence, azerbaijan has seen turkey as a counterweight to russian power. at present, however, turkey has its own complex relations with russia. turkey enjoys the positive effects of continued close energy and pipeline relations, as well as personal interactions between putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan; but offsetting these effects are sharp differences between turkey and russia on the conflicts in syria and libya. azerbaijan seeks to ensure that turkey’s support vis-à-vis russia is unwavering. turkey’s support of azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement in the autumn 2020 fighting have granted azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver vis-à-vis russia—both on the battlefield and with regard to russian mediation efforts. it took the kremlin almost two weeks to arrange a putin-aliyev phone call; a humanitarian truce brokered by lavrov fell apart almost immediately.', 'china has increased its engagement with the caucasus as part of its belt and road initiative, though neither its trade nor investment in the region compare with its far more massive engagement in central asia.', ' its main partner in the region is azerbaijan, which has the largest population, economy, and reserves of natural resources. the partnership makes sense geopolitically as well: although china is now a major trading partner for armenia and georgia, armenia is too dependent on russia to be pried loose and china is probably wary of russian sensitivities on georgia. china has now become the third largest source of imports for azerbaijan, after russia and turkey. azerbaijan presents the most potential for future political rapprochement, and china, unlike the west, is not burdened with concerns over azerbaijan’s human rights record. azerbaijan hopes that as the belt and road initiative progresses, china will increase its use of azerbaijan for the transit of cargo to europe—floating cargo across the caspian and loading it onto the railroad link opened in 2017 between baku and kars, in turkey, via georgia.', 'putin once famously declared that he would hang saakashvili by his testicles.', ' that promise remains unfulfilled, but not for want of trying. saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority in 2012 and was voted out of office in 2013. if putin thought saakashvili’s ouster by the billionaire (and, until shortly before then, russian citizen) bidzina ivanishvili and his georgian dream party would liberate a wellspring of affection for russia, he was in for disappointment. the georgian populace remains deeply suspicious of russia. in late 2014, nato initiated a major assistance program, the substantial nato-georgia package, sharply ramping up security cooperation with the georgian dream government.', 'russia’s hostile and aggressive policy toward georgia, too, remains unchanged. as always, the pressure point between russia and georgia has been separatism, namely the russia-backed polities in abkhazia and south ossetia. in the run-up to putin’s return to the presidency, long-serving local officials in many areas controlled by russia, especially in the russia-supported south ossetia and abkhazia (and transdniestria, outside the region), were ousted, with moscow backing newcomers who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience to putin alone. at the end of 2011, edmund kokoity, who had ruled south ossetia since 2001, was forced to resign from the leadership and was ultimately replaced by leonid tibilov, a veteran of the kgb.', ' in abkhazia, the death of sergei bagapsh in may 2011 triggered a premature power struggle that threw the plans off track; in the elections that followed, moscow’s chosen candidate, raul khajimba, was defeated. however, with the intervention of putin’s fixer vladislav surkov, president alexander ankvab was ousted in june 2014 and khajimba was installed.', 'by then, russia had occupied and annexed crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprisings in donbass, as well as kharkiv and odessa; in response, the west had imposed sanctions. perhaps this left putin and his regime less concerned with placating western opinion, and he moved to annex the separatists in all but name. as early as october 13, 2014—the month after khajimba’s inauguration—russia presented abkhazia with a draft treaty of alliance, integration and partnership, whose main points were the takeover of key executive departments of the abkhaz “state” by their russian homologues, with, at best, nominal abkhazian security institutions serving as a fig leaf. russia presented south ossetia with a draft comprising identical terms at about the same time, though the first public announcement came in november. in the treaties that were eventually signed, the abkhaz won face-saving concessions from the russians;', ' it took four drafts before the south ossetians signed, but their version was closer to the russian original.', ' (the close informal relations between south ossetia and north ossetia made the words on paper less important.) the stifling embrace of moscow—and the suspected poisoning of khajimba’s electoral rival', '—led to the ouster of khajimba in early 2020 and his replacement by aslan bzhania, himself a veteran of the kgb.', ' in south ossetia, anatoliy bibilov, who had floated between the north and south ossetian militaries, defeated tibilov.', 'russian actions have continued to ensure that georgian resentment over the ', ' remains an open wound. the process of borderization continues in south ossetia: russian border troops periodically erect new border fences that enclose bits of land hitherto under georgian control. in july 2015, new border fences cut off part of the strategic baku-supsa oil pipeline, the line that carried azerbaijani “early oil” to market in the west before the main baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline was completed. russia has not interfered with the oil flow, but the implied threat is clear.', 'for its part, it appears that georgia under saakashvili tried to return this threat by reopening links with chechen and islamist rebel groups in the north caucasus, as shevardnadze had done with the chechen commander gelayev in 2001. russia charged in 2009—and again in 2012 after a murky incident in the lopota gorge (between the pankisi gorge and dagestan)—that georgia was arming and training chechen militants to fight inside russia. in 2017, several years after saakashvili was replaced by the less anti-russian georgian dream party, the chechen commander involved in the lopota incident was killed by georgian security forces in tbilisi.', 'thus, a cycle of perceived provocations followed by emotional reactions and retaliations continues today. most recently, a russian’s mere choice of seating at a meeting led to crisis between the two countries. from june 19 to 23, 2019, the interparliamentary assembly on orthodoxy met in the parliament in tbilisi with orthodox parliamentarians from many countries in attendance. this was presumably intended as a gesture at reconciliation between the orthodox majorities of russia and georgia. on june 20, a member of the russian state duma presided over the session and sat in the georgian parliament chair’s seat. violent street protests immediately broke out in tbilisi, disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation of georgia’s parliament chair the following day.', ' amid continuing protests against russia in tbilisi, putin ordered the cessation of direct flights between georgia and russia—as he had in the run-up to the 2008 war.', ' the incident highlights that symbols of power relations evoke both charged emotions and material retaliations and that the pattern of events will be repeated for the foreseeable future.', 'it is hard not to conclude that putin’s personal overreach in ukraine has led to suboptimal results for russia in the south caucasus. when he resumed the presidency of russia, putin increased engagement with the south caucasus, perhaps hoping to gather some castaway stones closer into the russian camp. by autumn, 2013, everything seemed to be going his way: armenia (and ukraine) had bowed to his demands to reject association agreements with the eu and to sign on instead with the eaeu that putin had singlehandedly created, promoted, and dominated. relations with azerbaijan were on an even keel without much expenditure of effort. and georgia’s despised saakashvili had been replaced by a russian billionaire whose government was floating trial balloons about normalizing relations with moscow despite russia’s recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia.', 'but relations with all three south caucasus countries reverted to type after russia’s intervention in ukraine. moscow’s stifling embrace of rulers such as sargsyan and khajimba led to popular discontent and their forcible ousters. the precedents set on ukrainian territory led azerbaijan to proceed with extreme caution in its relations with russia. and russia’s expansionist policies with regard to abkhazia and south ossetia have guaranteed the hostility of the georgian populace and repudiation by what might have been a friendlier government. as observers have noted, major outside powers such as china, turkey, and the eu have capitalized on local suspicions of russia. they have developed strong interests in all three south caucasus countries and have the wherewithal to defend those interests against russian maneuvering, while also providing the locals with greater room for maneuver. turkey’s willingness to take a major military role in support of azerbaijan in the fighting that began september 27 shows that russian power no longer has the deterrent effect it once did against intervention by outside powers. russian interests themselves are not yet seriously threatened, but expansion of those interests has been blunted. one can say, then, that russia’s policies in the south caucasus and in the wider post-soviet space have forced it back on the stony path it had been treading for a generation and will probably tread for some time to come.', 'philip remler is a nonresident scholar at the carnegie endowment for international peace. prior to joining carnegie, he

have seen the topic pop up every day on multiple talk shows. among the elite, the duel between u.s. president donald trump and former vice president joe biden has become the favorite topic of conversation at fancy restaurants and in the corridors of power.', 'the prevailing view is that a victory for biden would be bad for russia, because a democratic administration is expected to impose new economic sanctions on moscow as punishment for its bad behavior—first and foremost, for its interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election. this view is widely shared by pro-kremlin pundits, senior officials and the executives of state-owned enterprises, and is even promoted by the few remaining independent russian media outlets such as the ', ' newsletter, a daily staple in the information diet of the russian upper-middle class.', 'a more nuanced view on biden is held by some people working on u.s. issues in the russian government. a president who is not tainted by suspicion of being a russian asset—and who knows how to organize a normal process for national security discussions—will be able to restore some guardrails to the u.s.-russia relationship and prevent further deterioration, those people argue. a president biden would not be able to pay close attention to russia, since he and his senior advisers will be overwhelmed by domestic issues and otherwise focusing on china. but a possible new democratic administration appears to be open to retaining some pillars of the arms control regime and discussing rules of competition in cyberspace. and it could be more clear-eyed—and therefore skeptical—about the side effects and efficiency of sanctions as the united states’ major tool in russia policy. much will depend on who is put in senior positions such as secretary of state and national security advisor, and on the midlevel bureaucrats controlling the russia portfolio.', 'after u.s.-russian relations nearly hit rock bottom on trump’s watch, nobody in russia believes that four more years of trump could be good for moscow. if trump is reelected, the only silver lining will be the even deeper level of disarray in the western alliance and u.s. disengagement from its partners that a second trump term would likely bring. for the kremlin, schadenfreude over the gradual demise of pax americana would simply sugarcoat the risks and downsides of

very least, analysts expect that a victory for biden would increase tensions between washington and moscow, and would raise the probability of new sanctions on russia.', 'the country is already operating under international sanctions on some key sectors and russian officials close to putin, for actions including its annexation of crimea from ukraine in 2014, interference in the u.s. election in 2016 and reported involvement in a nerve agent attack in the u.k. in 2018.', 'andrius tursa, central and eastern europe advisor at teneo intelligence, said a win for biden would improve transatlantic ties between the u.s. and europe and would see "a renewed u.s. commitment to nato" that would be welcomed by europe.', 'however he also said such a result would mean "mostly downsides for russia," citing a recent history of mutual distrust and acrimonious relations between the kremlin and u.s. democrats.', '"in general, a potential biden presidency would be negative for moscow and likely lead to a further deterioration of bilateral relations, both in terms of rhetoric and substance. the democratic party\'s candidate has long maintained a tough stance towards president vladimir putin\'s administration," tursa said in a note friday.', '"the kremlin\'s disdain for biden, meanwhile, dates back to his vice-presidency, particularly his push for sanctions against russia in response to the 2014 ukrainian crisis."', 'a meaningful conflict resolution over crimea, and in the donbass region in east ukraine (where there are two pro-russian regions that declared themselves republics) still eludes moscow and kiev, despite efforts by germany and france to broker a lasting settlement that both sides can live with.', 'tursa argued that without tangible process in ', ' – a region biden was heavily involved in as vice president – "moscow could hardly expect any meaningful easing of sanctions," and that a potential biden presidency could lead to more stringent enforcement of existing measures.', 'the risk of new sanctions could also increase, he said, ', 'any new sanctions on russia are unlikely to be imposed immediately, however, according to timothy ash, senior emerging markets strategist at bluebay asset management.', 'he said on saturday that "while i do think the course of u.s.-russia relations will remain on this deteriorating path i am not sure\xa0that we should expect an immediate rollout of additional \'pent up\' sanctions on russia."', '"i think those candidates likely to be running russian affairs in a biden presidency are all pretty experienced and level headed. they won\'t want to roll out sanctions for sanctions sake. they will want to be very proportionate and logical in approach," he said, emphasizing that it\'s "important for the u.s. to have a business-like relationship with russia to ensure delivery on the u.s.\'s strategic interests."', 'he said the two sides, under a biden presidency, would have to "learn where they can tolerate each other and get along on certain areas of mutual interest — such as arms control — and reducing risks of conflict where strategic interests compete, for example on areas like ukraine, even belarus and turkey. sanctions will be part of the tool kit herein, but only one such tool."', ' is an area that both russia-watchers believe could be a point of mutual interest and some harmony, however. biden has signaled as much, saying in 2019 that he would want to see an extension of the major u.s.-russian nuclear arms reduction treaty, known as the new strategic arms reduction treaty, or the implementation something similar.', '"based on recent statements from both sides, negotiations on a new strategic arms reduction treaty (start) is one area where progress could be expected if biden is elected," teneo\'s tursa said. "however, the timeline would be extremely challenging as the current treaty expires on 5 february 2021."', 'russia itself has acknowledged that arms control could be one positive dynamic under a biden presidency. earlier in october, putin criticized what he called "sharp anti-russian rhetoric" from biden, but also said that he had been encouraged by biden\'s comments regarding a new arms treaty or extension of new start.', 'got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you.', 'sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inbox', 'get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\xa0', '© ', '2020', ' cnbc llc. all rights reserved.', ' ', 'data is a real-time snapshot *data is delayed at least 15 minutes. global business and financial news, stock quotes, and market data and analysis.', 'data also provided by', ' ']['updated 2216 gmt (0616 hkt) november 2, 2020 ', 'a group of masked assailants killed a russian businessman dubbed the "sausage king" with a crossbow at his country residence in the moscow region, russia\'s investigative committee and state media reported monday.']['watch cbsn live', '\n                  by alexandra odynova\n              ', '\n      ', '\n      / cbs news\n    ', '\xa0— russia confirmed a record 17,340 new ', ' cases on friday, but despite the rise, and ', ', authorities pledged not to reimpose strict lockdown measures across the country and declared the epidemic "under control."

significance, is to enlist russian internet companies in the government’s foreign espionage efforts. this topic may be downplayed due to well-justified cynicism: it would of course be naive to assume

the power of the government to requisition user data from privately owned social media companies expressly in order to conduct espionage abroad.', 'what sets this apart from the surveillance practices of most democratic governments (including the united states) is the lack of any political or legal checks that could serve to protect users’ privacy. when edward snowden’s 2013 disclosure of the prism

international companies, while certainly more optimistic, is also less clear.', 'moscow’s goals when it comes to international technology companies—those incorporated in other countries but operating

broader picture of government efforts to centralize internet data flows, designed at the internet’s inception to prioritize fast and reliable delivery above all else, to enable more effective government management and surveillance. though the process is often purely technical, the objectives are fundamentally political. in practice, these measures allow the russian government to surveil dissidents, ensure the privacy of russian citizen data against perceived malicious foreign access, and extend state information control in the digital domain.', 'simultaneously justifying two of the kremlin’s other main goals in this sphere—disrupting the potential for political pluralism enabled by foreign tech platforms and projecting the state’s own disinformation through those same vectors—requires a kind of argumentative gymnastics. the russian government has for years required foreign internet companies operating in russia to remove content it deems “false.”', 'should

state-controlled news outlets.', 'these inherent contradictions in the russian government’s approach to international tech companies—the kremlin wants these companies to operate in russia but only on the kremlin’s own terms; it pressures companies to suppress free speech inside russia but howls when russian government messaging abroad is met with wariness—mean that there is still space for international companies to effect a certain extent of internet freedom for russian citizens. this operating space, however, is under constant threat from the russian government and is likely to be the site of several major conflicts in coming years.', 'first, international firms may continue to push back against certain elements of russian state internet control. u.s. firms that have mostly resisted complying with data localization rules have not indicated any changed willingness to follow kremlin pressure. though, resistance of this kind won’t apply to every area online; it’s important to not group different components of internet control here. content takedowns, for example, are one domain of internet control in the covid-19 pandemic where the russian government was quite successful in getting even u.s. social media companies to ', ' from their platforms, within russia, that officials deemed “false.”', 'second, the struggle to maintain a “free internet” in russia will

are already installed.', 'the united aircraft corporation, which now has manufacturing responsibility for the blackjack, announced that the “deeply modernized” tu-160m had performed its first flight with its new serial-production nk-32-02 engines at the kazan aircraft production association airfield in southwest russia on november 3, 2020. the flight lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes and saw the

“was equipped with new flight and navigation equipment, an onboard communications system, modernized control system, radar, and ', '.”', 'lack of engines had been a serious hurdle in moscow’s ambitious plans to restart production of the blackjack, which had originally come to a halt in 1994 after just 36 examples - three of them non-flying static test airframes - had been completed. with the collapse of the soviet union, 10 of the tu-160s left in ukrainian territory were scrapped. another four of the bombers were left unfinished on the assembly line and two of these were eventually

southwestern city of samara received a contract to restart production of the blackjack’s nk-32 turbofans, now producing an improved nk-32-02 version. the first of these engines was planned to be ready for tests in 2016 and some observers have expected that the same powerplant to be used in russia’s still-secretive and still-unseen pak da new-generation bomber. as well as powering new-build

over 55,000 pounds of thrust at full afterburner.\xa0', 'while the nk-32-02 is considered a “new” engine, it actually dates back to the mid-1980s, when the soviet union canceled its production on cost grounds. the improvements over the initial design included new blades for the compressor and turbine, plus more efficient cooling.', 'the nk-32-02 is understood to have the same output as the original powerplant but offers increased efficiency, extending the bomber’s range by around 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, according to russian media reports. tupolev has in the past claimed a 13 percent overall range increase. \xa0', 'the program to get the blackjack back into production has been a protracted one, perhaps not altogether surprisingly, as the effort to reinstate a production line and setup required tooling after decades of inactivity is considerable. in january 2018, the russian ministry of defense signed a contract for the next 10 new-build blackjacks, which cost around $270 million per copy. plans called for a first example for the russian aerospace forces to be rolled out in 2021; according to ', ', this schedule is still on track.', 'in the past, the russian

with the new-production blackjacks, russia has been busy with a mid-life upgrade program for its existing tu-160s, including new mission systems and avionics. originally, the existing bombers were to be designated tu-160m after completing their upgrade, while the new-build aircraft would be designated tu-160m2. this has now been rationalized, and both variants are now known as tu-160ms.', 'therefore, the first aircraft to be re-engined with the new nk-32-02 turbofans is not a new-build blackjack, but either an example from the earlier production batch that has been brought up to tu-160m status or a prototype for the new-build aircraft constructed using one of the two incomplete airframes from the original production run.', 'one of these two unfinished aircraft has been

modernization,” or tu-160m1, and provides a digital upgrade for the aircraft’s inertial navigation and engine control systems, as well as armament.', 'russia’s deputy prime minister yuri borisov has said the russian aerospace forces will continue to operate modernized tu-160ms (both upgraded and new-build examples) “until the 2050s or even the 2060s.”\xa0', 'considering the blackjack can now

the other hand, the continued focus on the blackjack — including the tricky task of bringing it back into production — should be seen against the prospects for the future pak da, which stands for perspektivnyi aviatsionnyi kompleks dalney aviatsii, or future air complex of long-range aviation.\xa0', 'the research and development program for the pak da began around 2009, ', ' the order to resume tu-160 production. that suggests that difficulties faced by the pak da program led to the new bomber program’s priority being reduced in favor of the tried and tested blackjack.', 'to this day, there has been no official concept art of the pak da, so we really have no idea what the design looks like. however, most observers expect that it will be a subsonic “flying wing” design, possibly with low-observable (stealthy) features.', 'tupolev’s concept for the pak da was apparently approved in 2013, after which the united aircraft corporation received a follow-on contract for detailed design work and other contracts to develop the aircraft’s systems. the then commander of russia’s long-range aviation branch, anatoly zhikharev, said in late 2014 that a pak da prototype would fly in 2019.', 'in 2015, however, the idea of resuming series production of the tu-160 appeared and with this, the urgency assigned to the pak da seems to have diminished. indeed, speaking in 2018, deputy prime minister borisov described that relaunching production of the blackjack was “a less risky path” than the pak da. “at the same time, we have postponed the pak da, to gain experience and restore technology”, he added. borisov’s predecessor, dmitry rogozin, had the same year said that the pak da would perform its first flight in 2023 or 2024.', 'the prospects of the pak da taking to the air in that kind of timeframe seem remote, especially as the focus is now on the tu-160’s continued upgrade and production restart, which will consume both funding and production capacity at the kazan plant. meanwhile, similar upgrade programs for the ', ' and ', ' strategic bombers further reduce the urgency of getting the pak da into service.\xa0', 'there is also the enormous cost involved in getting a

media’s been obsessed with russians under the bed, but to have the president of the united states telling people in the us that they can’t trust the results of the election – putin could only dream of that kind of thing.”', 'russia’s disinformation campaign in the 2016 presidential election had two main vectors: a social media campaign to sow division and distrust among voters, and a “hack and leak” operation that resulted in the theft and publication of emails and documents stolen from democrats and hillary clinton’s campaign. that hack and leak operation was incredibly successful, with caches of stolen material proving irresistible both for the mainstream press and for conservative activists and conspiracy theorists.', 'people have been overwhelmed with falsehoods and confusion. when people get overwhelmed, they either fight or flee', 'the 2020 iteration of the hack and leak tactic – trump’s attorney rudy giuliani pushing dubious emails and text messages supposedly obtained from a hard drive linked to joe biden’s son hunter – has been something of a damp squib, however. “you don’t see the same kind of credulous, knee-jerk out-of-control amplification that you saw in

newspapers have debunked and deflated giuliani’s claims, and the idea of the pilfered hard drive has failed to capture the public’s interest in the same way that troves of stolen emails did.', 'but while the trump re-election campaign may have failed to recapture the magic of 2016 when it comes to hacked emails, the president has taken russia’s 2016 social media playbook and supercharged it with the power of the white house.', '“i’m sure that there is some foreign influence stuff happening and we might know more about it later,” said phillips. “but so much of the pollution is trickling down

friendship towards russia, though not always lived up to it. in fact, moscow is quite tired of lukashenka’s two-faced behaviour, and would like to see a change in minsk. it might also accept some change in nagorno-karabakh – as long as it happens on moscow’s terms, or at least on terms understandable to moscow. \xa0', 'russia’s true aim in these neighbourhood conflicts is not to back particular sides or personalities, but to defend the principles it values. it wants to delegitimise bottom-up revolutions as a means of transferring power; it also wants to signal that western interventionism with its promotion of democracy and normative approach are unfruitful in general, and unwelcome around russia in particular. what is playing out is essentially the same philosophy that guided russia’s intervention in syria – and if judged against these criteria, moscow is doing well enough, at least at the moment.', 'moscow wants to delegitimise bottom-up revolutions as a means to arrange transfers of power', 'in belarus, for instance, moscow might be backing lukashenka for now, but in reality it is already working on his replacement. this process will take some time; lukashenka will have some say over the terms of his exit. a recent meeting he held with opposition figures in jail was probably part of this process. svitlana tsikhanouskaya, though – the opposition leader now based in lithuania and the likely real winner of the rigged election – has probably been prescribed the role of bystander by moscow. and so has europe. from the start, moscow has shunned all european calls for due procedure, respect for human rights, and mediation by the osce. vladimir putin last week encapsulated his country’s position, though somewhat hypocritically, when he ', ':

azerbaijan emboldened by turkish support – might suggest that russia is facing a rival power in its neighbourhood. but for many in moscow the advantage of having the west out still outweighs the nuisance of having turkey in. moscow knows ankara and has learned to work with it. the two capitals are far from being allies: their goals in the middle east often stand in direct opposition to each other. but both realise they need each other, as they cannot achieve their aims without some acquiescence from the other. and most importantly, the turkish government is motivated by goals that in the kremlin’s eyes are rational: strengthening its power at home, enhancing its leverage abroad, and pursuing economic and security interests. it lacks any western-style rule-centric approach and instead subscribes to a worldview that moscow understands.', 'azerbaijan, too, has pursued its foreign policy without challenging russia’s philosophical standpoint or historical narratives even though at times it has been at odds with moscow. this is why russia might be more relaxed than expected, even though its armenian ally is in trouble: “russia may have reasons to help its ally armenia, but it

‘armenian-style’ political transition with no geopolitical contest around it.', 'all to no avail. after adopting a wait-and-see position for around two weeks after the election, moscow made up its mind and embarked on a strategy of transition – one that saves some face for lukashenka; deepens russia’s leverage in the country; brings to power a leader acceptable to moscow; keeps both the west and the osce at arm’s length; and, most importantly, demonstrates that popular revolution is not an effective way to transfer power. one can imagine scenarios under which moscow could reconsider its approach, change strategy, and even reach out to the lithuania-based opposition. but all these would stem from developments inside belarus itself – such as strikes that paralyse the country, or the

support of governor sergei furgal in khabarovsk, july 12, 2020.', 'khabarovsk, the largest city in russia’s far east, is known for its classical architecture, winter ice sculptures, and now, the country’s longest running protest. for more than a hundred consecutive days, thousands have taken to the streets waving flags, holding pickets and staging marches.', 'the protests were sparked in july by the arrest of the region’s former governor, sergei furgal. a charismatic businessman and local politician, furgal scored a surprise electoral victory over his predecessor vyacheslav shport, the kremlin’s preferred candidate, in 2018. in dramatic scenes earlier this year, he was pulled out of his car and arrested by federal officers, who had been flown in directly from moscow. he stands accused of involvement in a series of murders of business rivals in the region in the early 2000s.', 'the incident has since become a focus point for frustrations in the far east. while protestors initially demanded furgal’s release from the moscow jail where he is being held and for his case to be tried locally, their chants are now more often broad criticisms of both president vladimir putin and moscow. many commentators have been quick to speculate that these protests – in a region where they had previously been unheard of – mark the beginning of an organized, moderate alternative to putin’s russia. however, the reality is far more complex.', 'the liberal democratic party of russia, to which furgal and his allies belong, is far from that moderate movement. in reality, it has tended more toward ultranationalism than liberalism, calling for russian expansion into ukraine and belarus. in 2013, the party’s representatives in the state duma proposed a bill banning the use of

the week, and developing stories to watch across the asia-pacific.', 'instead, while those taking to the street have vented frustrations at the kremlin, their complaints appear to be less about domestic policy than regional autonomy. the scion of a prominent khabarovsk family, furgal’s local credentials were key to his popular support. as one protestor pointed out, “normally the governors are sent to the region from moscow… but furgal was different. he helped us.” his arrest – and the appointment of mikhail degtyarev, a moscow politician, as his interim replacement – created a narrative that the kremlin was interfering in local affairs from afar.', 'russia’s expansive east, beginning at the urals and stretching through siberia to the sea of japan, has long had an uneasy balance with its western center. since the days of imperial russia, its towns and cities have been seen as a mere extension of the european nation – an asian frontier to be settled and tamed. as part of the soviet union, mass deportations eastwards and its status as a destination for gulag prisoners reinforced that notion. but now, as the protesters in khabarovsk show, russia’s far east might be forming its own identity.', 'one major point of contention is that while eastern russia holds much of the country’s natural resources – including oil, gas, and rare earth metals – the proceeds from their extraction are widely seen to line pockets in the west, rather than enriching local communities. a series of environmental catastrophes in the far east, such as a petrochemical spill that led to

minority ethnic groups, and the far east is home to more than 25 distinct cultures. unlike the rest of the country, protestant congregations far outnumber those belonging to the moscow-based orthodox church. in the 19th century, ukrainians were encouraged to settle along the southeastern limits of the far east, from the border with china to the sea of okhotsk. the scheme was so successful that, after the bolshevik revolution of 1917, ukrainian-majority areas centered on khabarovsk attempted to declare their independence as “green ukraine.”', 'siberian regionalism or ', ' as it is known, has a long history, but in recent years it has faced a new source of opposition. after the fall of the soviet union, russia’s regions enjoyed unprecedented levels of local autonomy, with the federal

places like khabarovsk to the kremlin. his hand-picked governors, like the candidate that furgal defeated in 2018, have been the linchpins of that plan.', 'historically, moscow has used the precarious geography of the far east against those who sought to distance themselves from its power. with china’s eastern borders beginning just across the river from khabarovsk, the threat of expansionism and the need for protection was a compelling argument against going it alone. but now china’s presence in the far east is being felt in an altogether different way. beijing is behind billions of dollars of investment in the region, fueling both the stagnating economy but and ', ' with the local population.', 'russian media has repeatedly claimed as fact a narrative that chinese investment has been accompanied by mass chinese migration to the far east, creating fears that the region is within beijing’s sights. the reality that the ', ' has done little to assuage those concerns. one internet documentary, “china – a deadly friend,” went viral in 2015 with claims that chinese tanks could roll into central khabarovsk in under 30 minutes. in granting a series of concessions to chinese firms, moscow has itself become a ', ', with locals fearing their home is being offered up as “a raw materials supplier for the people’s republic of china.”', 'regional elections in september gave a clear sign that those tensions are coming to the fore. elsewhere in siberia, opposition candidates handed rare defeats to the ruling united russia party, with allies of poisoned opposition politician alexei navalny gaining seats in the central asian cities of tomsk and novosibirsk. while navalny’s blend of ethnic nationalism might have made him an unlikely figure for young russians to unite around, his prominence as a critic of the kremlin made his bloc the de facto choice for a protest vote.', 'while some in russia’s far east do occasionally speak of an independent “united states of siberia,” the idea lacks prominent supporters or any realistic prospect of success. however, the tensions behind it and the growing resistance to being directly governed from another continent will continue to define relations between russia’s center and its extremities. for those in russia’s far east, moscow might seem like a world away – with eight time zones and a five-day train journey dividing them. now though, the distance between the two looks to be growing.']['disabling auto-updates may improve reliability when using a screen reader or keyboard to navigate.', 'advertisement', 'supported by',

terrorist attack, colour revolutions, the georgian war, the economic depression in 2008, the 26/11 mumbai attack, the crimean referendum and its aftermath and the current covid-19 pandemic. it is therefore worth reflecting on the two decades of a seemingly positive bilateral engagement between india and russia. it is important to analyse how the agreement signed in 2000 has played a role in the continuum of ensuring the mutual understanding, peaceful cooperation and reliability between the two strategic partners. this is also an opportunity to critically evaluate the magnitude of our strategic relationship and the changes in the foreign policy priorities since 2000. given the current global context, the key question is how prepared are india and russia for insulating the strategic partnership amid the challenges in the post pandemic world?', 'the declaration of strategic partnership (2000) was signed at a time when the momentum in the bilateral relations between india and russia post-soviet collapse had fatigued due to several factors. but the most crucial factor of them all was the renewal of the ', '. the renewed 1993 treaty had almost written off the bilateral engagement, as russia clarified that it was no longer willing to make any defence commitment during the time of any external military threat to india – a key security clause (article ix) that constituted the very core of the 1971 indo-soviet treaty.', 'the strategic partnership treaty signed in 2000 gave a new lease of life as it restored india-russia relations to respectable levels.both the countries realised the need to develop a multifaceted bilateral cooperation in all possible spheres of defence, energy, space, nuclear, science and technology etc. india’s strategic partnership with russia since then has been unique, intense and substantive in many ways. mainly, the treaty led to the institutionalization of high level political interactions through annual bilateral summits – a key feature of the agreement to foster extensive collaboration and dynamism in the partnership. the twenty annual bilateral summits held so far between india and russia have in particular seen major agreements and initiatives undertaken to strengthen the partnership to higher levels.', 'additionally, in 2010, the bilateral ties were further elevated with the signing of the “', '.” arguably, the partnership between the two countries has been successfully reflected in many instances at regional and global platforms. ', ' general assembly referendum against russia for its accession of crimea in 2014 and russia’s unequivocal support to india on the kashmir issue are few cases in point.', 'regarding strategic partnership in sensitive spheres of cooperation between india and russia, defence cooperation continues to be one of the major boosters for engagement between the two countries. india has acknowledged russia’s contribution in assisting the former in military power projection and preserving its national security interests. although in recent times there is downgrading in the purchase of russian defence equipment by india, the cooperation in this sphere has been unassailable given that it has progressed from buyer-seller relations to joint research development and production, high-end technology transfer that has encouraged india’s quest for indigenous defence capabilities. from the induction of ins vikramaditya to the joint production of brahmos missile, india-russia defence cooperation has achieved new capacities through acquisitions and joint development. in fact, russia’s resurgence as a military power in recent times is conducive to india’s domestic initiatives such as the make in india project. the finalising of the ', ' despite the threat of imposition of caatsa sanctions has shown india’s predictable resistance to external pressures given its historical ties with russia.', 'indo-russian nuclear cooperation constitutes an important element of our strategic partnership. the kudankulam nuclear power plant (knpp) has become one of the biggest success stories of india-russia cooperation. as unit 1 and unit 2 start commercial operation, the process for reactor buildings of units 3 and 4 have already begun. with the construction of 12 nuclear power plants planned, india-russia nuclear cooperation has indeed reached new heights. india, russia and bangladesh signed a trilateral agreement in march 2018, for the construction of a npp in rooppur, bangladesh.', ' has been another major element of the strategic partnership, since russia, an export-oriented energy country, will aim to leverage its energy card with india, an import-oriented energy market. india’s interests in the arctic, for instance, especially energy resources, are a crucial aspect for india’s growing energy security needs. ', '. this is seen as a great step towards strengthening india-russia energy cooperation.', 'the bilateral partnership, which has a global strategic connotation, has seen both the countries enthusiastically promote the idea of building a multipolar world order and changing the global financial structure. in this regard, both india and russia have envisaged promoting a harmonious global order based on international law and collective decision-making that includes developing countries and is not monopolised by developed countries alone. india and russia, along with other players such as china, have succeeded in establishing non-western organisations such as brics and sco. the member states have, within their capabilities and limitations, established mechanisms that address economic and strategic interests, such as the new development bank. while brics and sco have become tools of political signalling on issues related to global affairs, there however exist asymmetries among the member states with regard to economic growth performance, distribution of resources and military strength. additionally, although china is a member of such multilateral organisations, at the individual level beijing has exercised assertive posturing that has caused concern in india. this can be seen by its irrational border claims and actions in the indian ocean region. the role of russia especially during the time of crisis between india and china is therefore anticipated to be non-partisan and meaningful.', 'when the treaty of strategic partnership was signed in 2000, the world was at the brink of a war on terrorism after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade centre. both india and russia, at their respective level, joined the bandwagon on the global war on terror. both parties, as bilateral partners which have been victims of terrorist attacks, voiced their interests and concerns in combating terrorism and related activities. india and russia have therefore cooperated at bilateral and multilateral levels. for instance, ', '. india and russia also share the mutual interest of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their possible acquisition by terrorist groups.', 'while both india and russia assert their distinctive identity in world politics respectively, the strategic partnership has seen close coordination of foreign policy interests to a wide range of international and regional issues. both countries firmly believe that intensification of the indo-russian strategic partnership can help respond to the challenges thrown up by global changes in a more effective way. while both india and russia have a diverging approach on the indo-pacific narrative, one cannot deny that the two countries understand the need for ', ' in accordance with the universally accepted principles of international law. this includes combating piracy at sea and providing humanitarian aid during natural disasters. the two countries have shown keen interest in restoring peace and stability in afghanistan. eurasian integration has been a key priority in the india-russia strategic partnership. russia understands that in its quest for “greater eurasia,” india is a vital player for its huge market potential, economic growth performance, military strength and enhanced position in international affairs.', 'strategic partnership in ', ' between india and russia since the soviet era and has continued to remain one even today. in fact, both countries have agreed to expand their relations in the aerospace sphere, an area of traditional cooperation for decades. more than 500 joint projects involving scientists and research institutes from both countries have been undertaken within the framework of various initiatives since 2000.', 'while critically evaluating the two decades of strategic partnership between india and russia, it is tempting to compare india’s strategic partnership with other major global players and the strategic partnership that it shares with russia. the new realities of the dynamic nature of international relations have definitely posed a challenge to the partnership. the pursuing of an all-alignment foreign policy has caused a certain level of discomfort in the bilateral relations. india’s growing proximity with the u.s. and russia’s compromised defence cooperation with china and mending of ties with pakistan in recent times has caused anxiety in the strategic partnership between india and russia. one possible inference that one can draw is the constant comparison to the current india-russia partnership with that of the nostalgia of indo-soviet ties. but one needs to bear in mind that compared to the strategic partnership that both india and russia share with other major players, there are limitations and shrouded with lack of trust. india’s defence relations with u.s., for instance, is yet to make any substantive development in joint production and restrictiveness about its technology compared to russia’s generosity to sharing defence technology and russia’s relations with pakistan is eclipsed with lack of trust and understanding. as for russia-china relations, there is growing speculation of a possible role reversal in the partnership given china’s growth in global politics in recent times.', 'however, there are few stumbling blocks in india-russia defence cooperation, especially the shifting trends in partnership, for example defence engagement between russia and china. russia’s current cooperation with china has emerged exclusively, as it includes cooperation in sensitive fields, such as strategic missile defence, hypersonic technology, and the construction of nuclear submarines. with ', ', allowing for the latter to be well equipped with similar and more advanced capabilities, china is a major security concern for india. hence, given the way ', ', collaboration in advanced future weapon systems, including quantum technology and artificial intelligence, should be enhanced further between india and russia.', 'indo-russian relations are undoubtedly at the cusp of a litmus test. nonetheless, the strategic partnership should see the future of asia beyond the u.s. and china factors, and both india and russia can play a decisive role in promoting their mutual interests in the region.', 'the rapid and uncontrollable spread of covid-19 in the past seven months has impacted the global order and the interconnected systems. reflecting the spirit of the partnership in times of crisis, ', '. russia also welcomed india’s goodwill gesture to send medical supplies to help fight the virus.', 'critics have often pointed out that the strategic partnership is yet to achieve its full potential, given the fact that some of the spheres of cooperation continue to be remain obsolete, for instance, the economic relations. additionally, given nearly 70 years of diplomatic relations, soft power capabilities, cultural diplomacy, academic exchange programmes, and labour migration are at an imperceptible status.', 'trade and investment remains the weakest link in our strategic partnership and falls far short of our potential, which unfortunately is not commensurate with our high-level political cooperation. post the announcement of the strategic agreement in 2000, which largely promotes the strengthening of economic relations between india and russia, the trade cart received much required upgrade. potential areas of trade have been explored, which include trade and investment, energy, nuclear, science and technology, pharmaceuticals, it, steel, diamonds, fertilizers, infrastructure, heavy engineering and food products. exploring economic prosperity, sustainable development, and free movement of people, information, knowledge, ideas and greater institutional links has also become crucial.', 'in fact, both countries have set a target of ', ' in each other’s country by the year 2025. it is also heartening that new options are being explored to further expand the domain of economic cooperation, eurasian integrity, regional cooperation, free trade agreements, connectivity and trade corridors have gained the utmost importance in the annual bilateral summits in the past two decades. the two countries have also set up mechanisms such as intergovernmental commissions. for example, ', ' (irigc-tec), the international north south transport corridor and the eurasian economic union, which have emerged as immediate priority areas for strong economic cooperation between the two countries.', 'the russian far-east is another region for potential economic engagement. india’s presence in the eastern economic forum (eef) is aimed at developing trade, commerce, investment, railway infrastructure, steel plants, defence, space, ports and shipping. india has successfully participated in the annual eef, with prime minister ', ' for the development of the far east. other than these developments, our economic ties are focused on exploring the potential of sub-regional cooperation. sub-regional cooperation has emerged as one of the prospective areas of cooperation and regional connectivity to add further impetus to the economic cooperation between india and russia. the key goal is to cement and institutionalise cooperation between the states and union territories of the republic of india and provinces of the russian federation.', 'to further bolster india’s far ambitions, an ', ' of four indian states led by the commerce and industry minister of india piyush goyal visited vladivostok to explore the opportunities and potential of business to business (b2b) cooperation in the far. with the introduction of the ', ' in the world, the need for both india and russia to tap the potentials of agricultural sector is crucial. regional connectivity needs due attention, hence the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors, such as chennai-vladivostok, needs prompt engagement.', 'the major impact of the pandemic has prompted countries to explore alternate market destinations and shifts in the business environment. the crisis has opened opportunities for countries such as india and russia to reposition themselves in the global supply chain. russia, with its efforts to attract investment to the far east, and india, with its huge manpower and existing available manufacturing units, should be endorsed as potential and suitable alternatives for manufacturing, instead of developed nations.', 'despite the seemingly successful bilateral relations between india and russia, the strategic community is incomplete if there is shortfall in establishing strong people-to-people engagement. since the soviet collapse, bilateral relations have seen minimal cultural diplomacy, academic exchange and labour migration. perhaps new vistas of cooperation could be explored to promote soft power capabilities between the two countries, such as cinema, which has always been one of the most successful foreign policy tools to enhance cultural exchange and people-to-people contact between countries.', 'the film industry is a great medium for spreading narratives, and in india movies have an immense following as well as impact on the minds of the population. india and russia collaborated in movie production during the soviet era, however, the trend did not last long due to the fall of the soviet union, among other factors. the time is right for both india and russia to collaborate in the entertainment industry, especially through joint production of movies and creating powerful narratives related to bilateral cooperation. india and russia must concentrate more on the content of the movie rather than joint production alone, as for the audience the content matters more than the producer. moreover, it can have an everlasting impact on the minds of the indian population if the content projects a russian character aiding/collaborating with an indian protagonist in a movie in bringing down an antagonist. also, the indian movie industry is always on the look for exotic locations in foreign lands. hence, in order to attract the indian movie industry, russia could look into easing travel and other shooting permissions within its jurisdictions. such an effort would not only bring closer industry ties, but also be able to showcase the russia and its rich culture to the indian population, thereby acting as a window of promotion for russian tourism.', 'regarding geopolitical realignment, today the global community is seeking pragmatic internationalism. the role of india and russia is crucial in their efforts to diffuse the multipolar world system. this is also relevant for regional alliances to actively engage politically and economically, which should help bilateral relations between the two countries elevate to a higher pedestal in post-pandemic world order.', 'the current global situation has given rise to some daunting challenges for the partnership once again. some of the ', ' are linked to the disruptions being caused to the international order by traditional and non-traditional threats such as climate change, ', ', secure communication challenges etc. nurturing hopes for stability and prosperity in eurasia in the post pandemic world, bilateral relations between india and russia and their proactive role in regional mechanisms such as sco, eurasian economic union (eaeu), and russia-india-china (ric) are viewed as an integral part of this construct. regional connectivity needs due attention including the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors.', 'in conclusion, the signing of the milestone agreement in 2000 was the outcome of developments that took place in bilateral relations between india and russia after the fall of the soviet union. the main aim of the agreement was to elevate the partnership to new level of cooperation and put speculations and uncertainties in the relationship to rest. over the past twenty years of relations, the partnership has seen many ups and downs. nonetheless, this has not allowed any major damage that could impact or lead to any serious conflict of interest between the two countries. having said that, the coveted relations built over the years cannot be taken for granted. in this regard, apart from political elites and bureaucrats playing a crucial role in enhancing the relations, academicians, artists, students, the research community, think tanks and educational institutions should contribute to forming the true essence of the partnership. the youth, in particular, need to draw inspiration from each other’s rich history and cultural relevance, carrying forward the vision for a long-term partnership. the engagement of both countries in the international ecosystem in the post pandemic world has become even more relevant, as it has given rise to new challenges and opportunities. the strategic partnership between india and russia nevertheless needs to insulate the mutual interests from challenges that emerge from within and from external factors. perhaps, the need for a reality check and serious introspection will be crucial as the challenges are only set to grow given the dynamism of international relations.', 'from our partner ', 'published', 'on', 'by', 'despite its large population of 1.5 billion which many have considered as an impediment, china’s domestic economic reforms and collaborative strategic diplomacy with external

at\xa0the\xa0same time, the\xa0roles of\xa0great britain and\xa0france in\xa0international affairs has undergone significant changes, he further explained.', 'the\xa0united states, which at\xa0some

brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history. china reduced extreme poverty by 800 million.', 'as expected of any development process, there are still problems. nonetheless, the level of public support for the government and its management of the country is high, with 80 – 95% of chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a 2019 survey.', 'that compared with russia, putin explained that russia has to begin from the scratch. lenin spoke about the\xa0birthmarks of\xa0capitalism, he reminded, and added that “it cannot

about your book is a perfect way for us to kick off what is for us,\xa0 going to be a new series on the key national security issues facing the united states. the series, which we're going to work very hard to be nonpartisan, will run between the ", " and the inauguration. and finally, i should mention to my listeners that this episode is going to run the day after the election, but that you and i are taping it the friday before the election. so you and i have no idea what's going to happen on election day. so people should just know that as they're as they're listening to our conversation. and i think that's actually a good thing for our conversation, because what i want to do at the end of the day is get your sense of what is going to face the president who is sworn in on january 20th, no matter who that person happens to be.", "michael morrell: h.r. before we get to the individual issues that i want to walk through with you, i'd love to ask you why you decided to write the book that you did. you obviously could have written a very different kind of book. and i'm sure that there were publishers who were encouraging you to do that. but you chose not to do that. you chose to write a very serious look at the threats and challenges that face us as a nation. why did you take the route that you did?", "gen. mcmaster: well, michael, thank you. i served in the army for thirty four years. so as i transitioned to what is my only second career in my adult life, i made out probably quite predictably, a mission statement for myself. and that was in my second career to try to deepen our understanding of the most crucial challenges we face as a way to better inform the american people about foreign policy and national security issues, and with the hope that if we learn more about these challenges that we face, we can demand better. demand a better foreign policy from our elected leaders. but then also, i hope that the book and the work that i'm doing around the book will help bring americans back together. right. because i don't think any of these issues should be partisan in nature. what i'm hoping for is that a deeper understanding of these challenges we face. and i think what should be our common commitment to try to build a better future for generations to come will help bring our country back together, at least around foreign policy and national security issues.", 'michael morrell: h.r., what are the main themes of the book? what do you want readers to walk away remembering?', "gen. mcmaster: well, what are the themes that runs through the book is this idea of strategic narcissism. i think this is one of the reasons why our competence, our ability to compete, at least in the post-cold war period, has been significantly diminished. and by strategic narcissism, i mean, our tendency to define the world only in relation to us and then to assume that what we decide to do or decide not to do is decisive to achieving a favorable outcome. and of course, you know, michael, with your long experience with intelligence, this is flawed because it's self-referential and it doesn't acknowledge, you know, the degree to which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future. so the book is then an argument, an argument for cultivating with my friend and great historian zachary shore has termed strategic empathy. and this is an effort, an effort to understand better what drives and constrains the other. especially adversaries, rivals and enemies and what drives and constrains the other often times is ideology and emotion and aspirations. so the theme in the book that also is important is an effort to understand how the recent past produced the present as the first step in making a projection into the future. so the book is an argument for the understanding of history and appreciation for the complex causality of events and a focus on understanding these crucial challenges we're facing from the perspective from the perspective of others.", "michael morrell: you know, that's one of the that's one of the main jobs of the intelligence community. right? is to is to give our decision makers the point of view of the other guy. the guy sitting across the table from you, the guy sitting across the battlefield from you. but what's the other guy thinking? what are his constraints? what are his interests? and that's extraordinarily important. right?", "gen. mcmaster:\xa0 of course, it's not a new idea. it goes back to sun tzu, but i think it's we started to neglect the importance of this, especially in the post-cold war period, a period that i describe as a period of over optimism. over optimism that led to complacency and a bit of hubris. and this over optimism was in large measure a set up, i think a set of for significant disappointments in the two thousands disappointments, of course, associated with the mass murder attacks of september 11th, 2001, but also the unanticipated length and difficulty of wars in afghanistan and in iraq and, of course, followed by a financial crisis. and so i think it was in the two thousands that this emotional impetus behind our foreign policy shifted from overoptimism to pessimism and from maybe a tendency to under appreciate the risks and costs of action, to a tendency to underappreciate the risks and costs of inaction. and i think that strategic narcissism is the cause, really, in both cases.", 'michael morrell: you know, the other thing that strikes me when you talk about the importance of history is i always thought sitting in deputies meetings that it would have been incredibly valuable to actually take a few minutes and every deputies meetings or principals meetings to talk about the history of the issue, just to review how you got from point a to point b, and we never did that in multiple administrations in which i served, but i always thought that that would have been really valuable.', "gen. mcmaster: \xa0well, michael, you're absolutely right about that. i'll tell you, one of the one of the great gifts i had, i think before earlier my career was the opportunity to read things, study and write history. and the first book i wrote was ", ', which is a story about how and why vietnam became an american war.\xa0', "and one of the lessons i learned from the study of that history was that it was important to understand problems and challenges holistically before leaping into action. when i came in as national security adviser, i did my best to at least avoid making the same mistakes and we put in place a principle small group framing session. i know that's a mouthful, but as we developed these strategies for the most crucial challenges we were facing, we began with this framing session that was organized around a five page paper that included only really the description of the challenge. how we got to where we are, a bit of the history of it, and then an inventory of our vital interests that were at stake, view of that challenge through the lens of those vital interests and draft overarching goals and more specific objectives, followed by assumptions.\xa0", "assumptions about the degree to which we and like-minded partners have agency or influence over this challenge. then an inventory of obstacles to progress and opportunities that we could exploit. and that's it. then we had a discussion about the nature of the challenge. first, the policy coordinating committee, which, you know, are the real workers who are going to work on this project. they're listening in. so they're getting, they're hearing at the cabinet level, a discussion about the nature of the problem and then a refinement of it. once that part of the meeting was done, then we shifted to a discussion of what are your ideas? how do we integrate the elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to overcome these obstacles and exploit these opportunities? then they got to hear the treasury secretary say what we have. we have economic and financial tools available. but those ought to be combined with diplomacy and maybe law enforcement efforts. and then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with. so i think that, i hope that's a process that will be sustained. i don't think my successor hung onto it. it will have to be resurrected at some point if it is deemed as useful by a future national security adviser.", "michael morrell: i'm michael morrell today, we have with us h.r. mcmaster, a senior fellow at both stanford university's hoover institution and its graduate school of business. a career u.s. army officer and national security adviser to president trump. ok, so what i'd love to do is go through the individual issues. and what i'd like to do is just throw one out, get you to frame it. what's the threat or challenge that we face? what's the history? how did we get here? what's our interest that's at stake? and how do you think we as a nation need to go about dealing with it? let's start with the big one. let's start with the big enchilada, china.", "gen. mcmaster: i think china is a great example of strategic narcissism at work, and especially this assumption that we clung to for too long, that china, having been welcomed into the international order, would play by the rules, would liberalize its economy, and as it prospered, it would liberalize its form of government. of course, that's not true. that's not true because we undervalue the degree to which emotions and ideology drive and constrain the chinese communist party. and what i would argue in battlegrounds is that the party is driven mainly by fear, fear of losing its exclusive grip on power and an associated ambition. the ambition to achieve national rejuvenation for china to take center stage in the world again after the tragedy, as they portrayed as the century of humiliation. it is that combination of fear and aspiration that is driving the party's effort to extend and tighten its exclusive grip on power internally.", "this is why there are over a million people in concentration camps in xinjiang and there's a campaign of cultural genocide ongoing.\xa0", "this is why the party is extending their repressive arm to hong kong and perfecting their technologically enabled orwellian surveillance police state. this is what we're seeing and then what is even more troubling, i think, is the parties now effort to export its authoritarian mercantilist model.\xa0", "through a number of strategies that aim to create servile relationships with countries and then ultimately through economic means, as well as the growth in the people's liberation army's capabilities to establish areas of privacy across the new pacific region that exclude the united states and then it challenged the united states in the free world globally. if china succeeds, i mean, our world will be less free, less prosperous and less safe. so the stakes are high and it's past time for us to recognize the need to compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form of aggression that the parties engaged in.", 'michael morrell: what would an effective china strategy look like to you?', "gen. mcmaster: well, i think the trump administration, if it gets credit for anything, should get credit for a fundamental shift in our policy toward china. one that was long overdue and one that i think is fundamentally sound and this is the idea that we have to compete. and it was under the strategy of of cooperation and engagement that the chinese communist party was emboldened. competition doesn't need to lead to confrontation. in fact, quite the opposite. and i think we have returned to arenas of competition involving countering more effectively china's campaign of sustained industrial espionage against us, countering a range of china's unfair trade and economic practices, doing so in large measure through effective international cooperation, for example, establishing better standards for infrastructure investment internationally, the law enforcement actions and investigations that have gone on against apt10.\xa0", "the main hacking arm of the chinese communist party, i think have been very effective as well, combined with sanctions and other actions against the aggressive arms of the party. but really, i think the most important thing for us to do, and i argue this in a chapter battlegrounds entitled turning weakness into strength is to take what the chinese communist party sees as sources of weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strengths. what does the party fear? the party fears that the people, the chinese people, might want to have a say in how they're governed so we should strengthen our democratic processes. the party fears rule of law. we should strengthen rule of law in the united states and with countries that are working to strengthen rule of law in their countries, the party fears freedom of press, freedom of the expression. we need to strengthen our authoritative sources of information and recognize that investigative journalism is a great counter to some of these pernicious strategies that the parties are pursuing. so i think that part of it is defensive, but part of it is more introspective and trying to maintain our competitive advantages.", "michael morrell: this is intelligence matters. i'm michael morrell. we're talking with former national security adviser h.r. mcmaster. so russia, how do you think about russia?", "gen. mcmaster: well, russia is a significant threat to us because putin again, is examining the assumptions of previous policies. putin is not going to become like the grinch on christmas eve. right, his heart is not going to get too big as the size gets bigger and he's not going to decide, ok, well maybe the future of russia does lie more with the west and treat the united states and europe and others differently. putin is driven by a sense of honor lost after the breakup of the soviet union. he is also driven by this associated desire to restore russia to national greatness. he's also cognizant, though, of the fact that he cannot compete with this on our own terms. and so what his theory of victory is, is to drag us all down and then to be the last man standing and the means that he's using to do this. i describe the chinese approach of cooption, coercion and concealment. and i use alliteration in the russian chapters as well.\xa0", 'it is a campaign of disruption, disinformation and denial to try to disrupt us, to disrupt our effective governance, to disrupt us economically and to use economic coercion when he can, such as he has done in europe effectively from time to time and with energy dependence. then to deny even his most egregious acts, especially the sustained campaign of cyber enabled information warfare against us, which is designed to polarize us, to pit us against each other, to reduce our confidence in who we are as a people and in our democratic institutions and principles and processes. russia is a dangerous threat for for these reasons. and the best way to counter the first step is to pull the curtain back on this activity, to educate ourselves about it, to be less susceptible to russian information, to not be our own worst enemies, as i think both political parties in many instances have because they compromise and they compromised our principles to score some partisan political points and in doing so, make themselves vulnerable to russian disinformation and propaganda.', 'michael morrell: then what about raising the cost to him of doing this? is that an option here in terms of deterring him?', "gen. mcmaster: absolutely. this is what i advocated for in battlegrounds is that we have to impose costs on the kremlin, on putin, that exceed those that he factors in at the beginning of his decision making process. it was my last day really in an oval office meeting, it was the day that president trump decided to impose significant costs on russia in response to the attempted\xa0 poisoning, murder of sergei skripal and his daughter with with a banned military grade nerve agent and an act that put thousands of uk citizens at risk. and it was at that on that occasion that we expelled you over 60 undeclared intelligence agents that hits putin where it matters. because these are agents that were critical to his sustained campaign of subversion against us. and we impose significant costs, additional costs on russia through sanctions and other actions, the closing of the san francisco consulate, as you know, michael, was a major intelligence collection platform for the russians here in silicon valley and the bay area. so, that was significant and i think that sent a strong message. now, after navalny's poisoning, i'd like to see us do the same thing, you know, and as he's infiltrating more little green men now into belarus and as he continues to enable the serial episodes of mass homicide, that is the syrian civil war, to support hawthorne's way perpetuating violence in libya.\xa0", "michael morrell: i'm michael morell. we're talking with h.r. mcmaster, former national security adviser to president trump and author of the just published book ", " by the way, if you missed any of today's show, you can listen to it as a podcast. just search ", "wherever you get your podcasts. let's talk about north korea. give us your sense on north korea?", "gen. mcmaster: well, thanks, michael. of course, it's important for us to recognize going in right that north korea is the only communist hereditary dictatorship in the world. and it is the nature of the kim family regime that we have to take into account when we're considering the danger that the regime poses to the world if it does possess the most destructive weapons on earth. the kim family regime is driven mainly by this drive to remain in power. it is, of course, known as the hermit kingdom. it is a gulag state that fears any kind of opening to the world. and it is a regime that across now three generations of dictators has been committed to unifying the korean peninsula under the so-called red banner. and i think as we look at north korea's pursuit of the most destructive weapons on earth, we have to be at least open to the possibility that it wants those weapons to coerce the united states off the peninsula as the first step in the forcible reunification of the peninsula. and, of course, that would that would be the form of a destructive war.", "gen. mcmaster: it's also important, i think, for us to recognize that it is highly unlikely that north korea wants nuclear weapons just to deter us. north korea already had a very significant deterrence capability with its conventional weapons. and the fact that it's so many thousands of artillery pieces are within the range of of seoul, south korea. and then also, i think it's important to recognize that every act of aggression on the korean peninsula since the north invaded the south in june of 1950 has been initiated by the north. the other aspect of this problem, michael, that is very important to consider is that if north korea gets the weapon is recognized as a as a nuclear power, like who doesn't get one after that? right. this japan starts to have conversation with south korea. by the way, north korea never met a weapon it didn't try to sell to somebody excluding its nuclear program until the israeli defense force bombed that facility in 2007. so it's very dangerous. i think it's dangerous as well because of the ideology that drives this regime. it's a warped ideology. this is the zushi ideology which has turned deprivation into a sign of virtue and racial superiority. and the north korean people have gone through generations of brainwashing. so this is a big problem, michael. i think that the approach that is in place now, the strategy of maximum pressure, it's the best course of action. i think we have to test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince kim jong un that he is safer without the weapons than he is with them. i think it will be important for whoever is sworn in on january 20th that they recognize that we should not repeat the failed pattern of previous efforts, not allow north korea to draw us into negotiations with an act of aggression and with the demands of big payoff up front just for the privilege of talking with them. to not again, engage in long, drawn out negotiations that delivers a weak agreement that he immediately breaks again.", "michael morrell: you've said something here that i think is really important, because i think the conventional wisdom is that he wants these weapons for deterrence. right. that he's worried about us attacking him. but you're arguing that it's more than that. that this gets to the heart of what north korea has always wanted, which is to reunify the peninsula, which i think is a really important point here that changes how you think about how you have to deal with him?", "gen. mcmaster: this is an argument, michael, for strategic empathy. right? to view these complex challenges from the perspective of the other and unless you do that,\xa0 you're susceptible to mirror imaging. and, of course, my research for the book, ", ', you know that sensitized me to this. it was in the run up to the vietnam war where some of those who were planning the vietnam strategy development, the strategy actually referred to the reasonable man theory of english common law and assumed that ho chi minh would respond as the theoretical reasonable man. would respond without taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played in driving and constraining the north vietnamese leadership.', "michael morrell: do you think at the end of the day it's possible to convince him that he would be better off, that he would be more secure without these weapons?", "gen. mcmaster: i do think it's possible, and the reason i think it's possible because we've never really put maximum pressure on the north. and so we have this opportunity now thanks really to the tremendous work by ambassador nikki haley when she was at the u.n. as you know, michael, these u.n. security council sanctions on north korea are unprecedented and reach. the key now, though, is to enforce them. of course, the key country that needs to enforce them is china. and i think if china doesn't enforce them, if china continues to be complicit with illicit financial flows into and out of the country, to continue to provide energy and other materials to the north that are limited by these sanctions. then i think it's time for us to consider secondary sanctions and maybe on chinese financial institutions.", "gen. mcmaster: i think as we see the smuggling of coal and the transshipment of coal and oil and fuel, i think that under article two, i think the president could use article two authority to interdict those ships. as you know, michael, this is something we can't really talk about. there are other means of putting pressure on the north. i think that we haven't done it yet. i think we have to at least test the thesis because the alternatives are so bleak of either accepting north korea as a nuclear power and coping with that threat or a war. right. that would be very costly, i think it's worth pursuing.", "michael morrell: we still have more to discuss with general mcmaster and we'll be right back with our final segment.\xa0", "michael morrell: we're back with more intelligence matters, i'm michael morrell. our guest is h.r. mcmaster, senior fellow at both stanford university's hoover institution and its graduate school of business. so, sir, let me ask you about another tough one, iran.", 'gen. mcmaster: on iran, what i tell the story of in ', ", michael, is we have to view the problem of iran with two fundamental considerations foremost in our minds. the first is the ideology of the revolution and how that drives iranian leadership and the iranian leadership is the supreme leader and the guardian council and the islamic revolutionary guards corps. we have this fantasy i think that the reformers, the republicans, within iraq are going to prevail. they lost, the revolutionaries are in charge. the hardliners are in charge. and whenever they put this forward, the shop window of minister zarif, their foreign minister or president rouhani, that's all you're getting is the shop window. that ideology is it drives the iranian regime to continue its four decade long proxy war against the great satan, the united states, the little satan, israel, the arab monarchies and the west broadly. and so we have to consider the ideology of the regime and and this 40 year long proxy war.", "gen. mcmaster: what i argue for in the book is to force the iranian regime to make a choice. you can either be treated like a normal nation or you can continue to wage this proxy war, to support terrorist organizations and keep the middle east enmeshed in this perpetual state of sectarian civil war. the choice is yours, and to impose that choice, i think what we should not do is lift the arms embargo to the regime. what we should not do is lift any of the sanctions. in fact, we should impose the costs on the regime to constrain the resources they have available to continue their proxy wars against us, but then also ultimately maybe to convince the iranian people. that they ought to have a government in place and i'm not talking about like a 2003 regime change, but a government in place that shifts away from its permanent hostility to the united states, israel and the west. i think that's the only path that i see forward. i think our policies ought to aim to effect that change in the regimes permanent hostility. and until it does any agreement with them, it can't be trusted and any agreement with them that allows them to escape. making that choice like the iran nuclear deal did, i think is to our disadvantage.", "michael morrell: so you don't see the regime changing policy on its own. do you think that has to be forced internally by the iranian people? is that fair?", "gen. mcmaster: well, michael, i think on iran, it's important to keep two considerations in mind in crafting a strategy toward iran. first of all, that it's the ideology of the regime that drives their hostile behavior toward us. and we have to recognize that it's the supreme leader, it's the guardian council, its islamic revolutionary guards corps, who are in charge. right. there was a struggle, you know, across the history of iran since the revolution in 1979 between the republicans and the revolutionaries. hey, the revolutionaries won. and and we have to recognize that the second consideration is that this regime has waged a four decade long proxy war against the great satan, us, the little satan, israel, the arab monarchies and the west generally. we have to craft our strategy in recognition of this regime's permanent hostility to us. of course, i think the best way to approach it in the title of the chapter in ", 'is ', ", forcing the regime to make a choice of either being a responsible nation and then being treated as such or suffering the consequences. and this is why i think it's very important to keep the arms embargo in place. i think it's very important to keep the sanctions in place on the regime to, in the short term, reduce the resources it has available to wage this proxy war and in the long term, hopefully convince the iranian people to demand a change in the nature of the government such that it ceases as permanent hostility.", "michael morrell: okay, islamic extremism, it's waned a bit in the threat, but it's still there. from west africa, to the middle east, to south asia, to southeast asia. how do you think about that problem long term?\xa0", "gen. mcmaster: i think the reason that we haven't had another attack on the scale of the most devastating terrorist attack in history of september 11th, 2001, is our tremendous intelligence professionals, our diplomats, our military who's been engaged against this threat from jihadist terrorist organizations since 9/11. what i'm concerned about, michael, is that these groups, i think are more dangerous today than they were maybe even on september 10th, 2001. and that's because, of course, those who committed the mass murder attacks against us on 9/11 were the mujahideen alumni of the resistance to the soviet occupation of afghanistan. well, now the al-qaida alumni, the isis alumni, the lashkar-e-taiba alumni are orders of magnitude greater and they have access to more and more destructive capabilities. and the reason we've been safe is because we've been engaged and now we have this narrative of ending endless wars and disengaging. well, i think what americans need to know is that we are engaged so we can enable others to bear the brunt of this fight. i mean, this disengagement from afghanistan, i think is a tragedy. the way that we've gone about this, i think we should recognize the sacrifices of our longest war and in particular that 10 of our courageous servicemen, soldiers, gave their lives for our country, our security this year. but we have to also recognize that 30 afghan soldiers and police a day die defending the freedoms that they've enjoyed since the defeat of the taliban in 2001 a removal of the taliban from power. so i think that we need to make a sustained argument to the american people for engagement with this problem of jihadist terrorism. because if we don't, michael, we'll go back to 1998. remember when we after the embassy bombings, we fired a few cruise missiles and called it a day. right, that didn't work out.", "michael morrell: the last issue i want to ask you about is venezuela, which i know you care about. my understanding is that when you arrived at the white house, you were going over the issues and you kind of stumbled on venezuela and said, hey, you know what's going on there? that doesn't look like we're paying attention to this, talk about venezuela and why it's important?", "gen. mcmaster: well, it's immensely important because this is a humanitarian catastrophe in venezuela. it's a humanitarian catastrophe that's brought on by an authoritarian regime that is denying the venezuelan people a say in how they're governed. when we looked at the problem and the nature of the maduro regime and the chavista movement, we concluded that this was, again, a corrupt government that is using criminalized patronage networks to effect control of its people. it uses these motorcycle gangs and militias to overwhelm any kind of opposition. it ended the constitution. so we said what's should our goal be? our goal should be to work with others, to work with like-minded countries, to effect a restoration of constitutional rule in venezuela. and to do that, we felt as if we had to pursue three objectives. one of those objectives would be to try to strengthen the opposition. right. to help the opposition come together. i think you saw that with the rise of bolsonaro. you know, who was really from the people. you know, he's not a member of the caracas polo club, for example. i think he's somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged now so significantly under chávez, and now maduro.", "gen. mcmaster: the second objective would be for the people to be able to attribute their grievances back to the government, not to blame the yankees, you know, for example. and the third related to that would be to try to galvanize really popular support for restoration of constitutional government. i think the measures we put in place were sound. of course, they have proven inadequate. and i think we thought that economic sanctions would maybe have a significant effect. but the reason they haven't had a bigger effect is there's a huge black market, illicit economy that's run by maduro. he uses that to sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gangs of thugs who really prevent any real opposition from gaining traction. but i think i'm proud of what we did in this period of time. we worked very closely with partners, especially in the western hemisphere, mexico, under the foreign minister of the great luis videgaray, who was a wonderful partner, took a leading role in much of the work that we did. we try'd to get the organization of american states and others to do more. but it was really the community of like-minded nations brazil, colombia, peru, panama, argentina. we worked very closely together on this problem and i think remain committed to trying to effect a restoration of constitutional government in venezuela.", "michael morrell: you've been fantastic with your time. i just want to ask you two more questions, we have a couple of minutes left, so we'll need to be quick here.", "michael morrell: the first is that in order to deal with all of these problems that you've talked about, you know, we need a healthy national security toolkit. healthy diplomacy, healthy intelligence capabilities, healthy military capabilities. what's your assessment sort of overall of where we are with our national security toolkit?", "gen. mcmaster: i think we're in good shape thanks to the extremely dedicated civil servants and military professionals, intelligence professionals who we have across our government. but i think what is needed more than anything is a higher degree of what i argue in ", " is, strategic competence, and that's the ability to integrate the elements of national power so that they're applied in a way that are synergistic. the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. i think at times we get it right, but most often we get it wrong. and our approach to these complex problems is fragmented. it's inconsistent. it's as i mentioned, you know, based on flawed assumptions about the nature of the problem. i think what i would like to see as well these days is even more of a concerted effort to foster multinational cooperation as i write in ", ". i mean, none of these problems are solvable by any one country. so it's very important for us to create the right venues for us to come together. not only to work on a discrete issue or event together, but really to think about these complex challenges. to frame them together and then to apply our competitive advantages between our like minded countries. so that we do have a synergistic effect and and so that we can build a better future for generations to come.", "michael morrell: the last question, i think anybody who's listened to the podcast up to this point is going to think, wow, that is a hard, tough list. i wonder at the end of the day, if you're optimistic or if you are pessimistic that we're going to get this right going forward.", "gen. mcmaster: michael, i'm optimistic about it. i'm optimistic about it even as we emerge from this\xa0 triple crisis. of the pandemic, the recession associated with it and the divides in our society, laid bare by george floyds murder and the protests and civil unrest that followed it. i think what's great about our democracy is we are self-correcting. the american people have a say in how they're governed. they can demand better. and the reason i wrote ", " is i think if the american people understand these challenges, they will demand a better foreign policy from from our elected leaders. you know, our founders knew that our democracy was going to require continuous nurturing. it's still true today. and i believe that we do have significant problems at home. but we also have to confront these challenges abroad because we know from the covid-19 pandemic that problems that develop abroad can only be dealt with at an exorbitant price once they reach our shores. so the argument of battlegrounds is an argument for sustained engagement with the world.", 'michael morrell: the book is ', ".' the author is h.r. mcmaster. general, thank you

mcmaster invited me to drop by his office. he had heard that the new york times was getting ready to report on ', ' that attempted to sabotage north korea’s missile programs with cyberstrikes. “is this the revelation of the modern-day enigma codes?” he asked, the military historian searching for an analogy from the world war ii operation to crack german ciphers.', 'it was a bracing start for what turned out to be a wild 13-month effort to devise a modern-day security strategy for a president with no experience, more interest in cutting deals than designing a long-term strategy — and an unwillingness to sit for intelligence briefings, much less discussion of containing an angry, decaying russia or of a 50-year plan to compete with a rising china. so “battlegrounds” is, at its heart, the mcmaster strategic plan that might have come to fruition had he worked for a president who was interested in strategic plans.', 'long before he walked into the west wing, mcmaster was the closest thing the army had to a soldier-scholar. his book about vietnam, ', ' was a devastating account of how the united states had a flawed decision-making process that was largely based on self-deception.', 'in many ways, “battlegrounds” is the sequel, seeking to ask the question of why — not whether — the united states, at another moment of protests in the streets and bitter partisan divides, is losing its ability to shape the world. but the answers this time are different, in mcmaster’s view.', 'the key to his argument is that america is suffering from what hans morgenthau called “strategic narcissism,” or, in mcmaster’s words, “the tendency to view the world only in relation to the united states and to assume that the future course of events depends primarily on u.s. decisions or plans.” it’s hard to argue with that premise: every new president comes to office assuming that the world is waiting for direction from washington. some countries are. others are looking for power vacuums they can fill, each in its own way.', 'that’s been the story of the past two decades. russia has emerged as a disrupter, knowing that it has neither the money nor the technology to take the united states on directly. china has become a builder — why threaten to cut undersea cables, as vladimir putin’s submarine force does, if you can dominate global communications? as rob joyce, an n.s.a. official who worked for mcmaster as the white house cybersecurity coordinator, said: “russia is the hurricane. … china is climate change.”', 'mcmaster realized that, and devoted much of his time in the west wing to writing a “national security strategy” that would reorient the united states away from nearly two decades of counterterrorism and toward countering moscow and beijing, which he called “revisionist powers.” it was an impressive document. unfortunately, the president under whose name it was published, aides concede, did not read it.', '“battlegrounds” expands on the written strategy — the one the white house has barely mentioned since it was published — and makes a strong case for containing russia, pushing back on chinese influence and using american leverage, and allies, to confront iran and north korea. what washington needs, mcmaster argues, is an integrated approach that recognizes that the old tools that drove saddam hussein out of kuwait in 1991, when mcmaster served, are pretty useless 30 years later.', 'he starts with russia. “the united states and europe were ill prepared for russia’s toxic combination of disinformation, denial, dependence and disruptive technologies,” he says, a recognition that what happened in 2016 was not that america’s radar was off. it’s that the radar was never built. fortunately, it has since been pieced together, and in the 2020 presidential contest, everyone from facebook to twitter to the united states cyber command has been pushing back. disinformation has been blocked, clumsily. ', ', at least briefly.', 'unfortunately, mcmaster’s boss was not on board with this approach. in mcmaster’s time, he notes, president trump often said improving relations with russia “would be a good thing, not a bad thing,” while succumbing to putin’s flattery and treating his criminal actions “with dismissiveness and moral equivalency.” and, of course, the repeated references to “the russia hoax,” which meant no one in the president’s circle could discuss election interference without dreading an eruption triggered by trump’s fear that the legitimacy of the election was being questioned.', 'mcmaster never deals head-on with the fundamental problem — that the administration had, on paper, a defensible russia strategy, and the president kept undermining it. instead, he cites his top russia aide, fiona hill, who, he writes, always warned that “putin seeks to divide; americans and europeans should not divide themselves.”', 'china, the climate-changer, is, of course, immune to containment strategies. if the old cold war was largely a military contest, version 2.0 is a military, diplomatic, economic and technological contest. that change led to a misappraisal of the challenge: as mcmaster points out, a succession of administrations convinced themselves that, over time, china would conform to a western-built system. (trump succumbed to a different illusion: that the chinese were all dealmakers, like the property developers he knew.)', 'crucial to mcmaster’s analysis is china’s strategy to wire together its own collection of allies and dependent powers — selling them controlled-in-china technology, from huawei’s networks to, after mcmaster departed, tiktok’s addictive app.', '“it took the united states a decade and a half to understand the immensity of the trojan horse it had let in,” he says of how the united states blindly let a chinese telecommunications giant gain ground, while american firms exited the market. but the reader yearns for mcmaster’s solution. ban chinese technology? maybe — president trump is trying — but even then china will dominate 40 percent or more of the world’s telecommunications networks. embrace an industrial policy that will win back the market?', 'it is in dealing with the two biggest failures of the trump administration, iran and north korea, that mcmaster sounds the loudest alarms. while he was a major critic of president obama’s 2015 nuclear deal with tehran, and criticizes obama’s aides for overlooking iran’s support of terrorism and terrorist regimes, he reports that internally he argued for staying inside the deal and using trump’s threats to toss it aside as leverage.', 'but the president wouldn’t think that many chess moves ahead, and dispensed with the whole deal a month after mcmaster left. now he fears that the united states, without allies to confront iran, may slip into the place we are with other nuclear powers that washington once declared could never possess nuclear arms:', '“pakistan provides a stark warning. iran could become, like pakistan today, a nuclear-armed state in which terrorists already enjoy a support base. the greatest threat to humanity in the coming decades may lie at the nexus between terrorists and the most destructive weapons on earth.”', 'north korea, of course, already has those weapons — and a lot more fuel for them now than when the trump administration arrived with its threats of “fire and fury” if they were not turned over immediately. it was the president’s ego that got in the way.', 'mcmaster knew, he says, that as soon as kim jong-un proposed a summit, the president “would find a historic first meeting between a north korean leader and a u.s. president irresistible.” not a single weapon or missile has been dismantled. but the sanctions regime is in tatters, undercut by russia and china.', 'which takes me back to mcmaster’s question his first day: are we facing the “modern-day enigma codes”? it turns out the enigma this time is us. americans want the unrivaled power, the global influence, and the economic growth and freedom that come with it, the kind we enjoyed with little challenge at the end of world war ii and then, briefly, after the collapse of the soviet union. but we want it free — without the strategic investments in the world, without forward-deployed troops, without marshaling the power of technologies america largely invented.', 'the biggest of mcmaster’s “battlegrounds” is here at home.', 'advertisement']['from ', ' to

institute for scholars, president vladimir putin and his top advisers only have themselves to blame for these crises on russia’s periphery, given their active assertion of “veto rights” over political outcomes that they find unfavorable, including any signs that a country is realigning away from russia and toward the west.', 'in many cases, this has meant staunch russian support for friendly authoritarian regimes in post-soviet states, leading to mass demonstrations or other forms of unrest. “in a way,” rojansky told wpr’s elliot waldman in an interview on the trend lines podcast this

domain – a worry that is likely to worsen as the number of fifth-generation aircraft grows to the west.', 'f-35a at heart of texas air show', 'there are seven european nato nations that operate or plan to buy the f-35: belgium, denmark, italy, the netherlands, and norway, poland and uk.', 'by 2025, those militaries ought to collectively own more than 200 examples of the stealth fighter. “this will exceed the number of us fifth-generation aircraft stationed in the european theater by a wide margin,” says the report. the combined force of f-35s possessed by european allies is likely to approach 400 aircraft by 2030 and would represent roughly 30 percent of the combined fleet.', 'for its part, russia plans to acquire 76 examples of sukhoi su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet by 2028. moscow said recently the first such stealth aircraft would be delivered by december 2020.', 'european allied air forces have around 1,900 fourth-generation fighters comprising types such as the dassault rafale, eurofighter typhoon and lockheed martin f-16. the combined force currently has less than 100 f-35s fielded, according to rand.', 'those fourth-generation aircraft would be vulnerable in a high-intensity conflict against russia, a country with robust surface-to-air missile defences.', '“during the opening phases of a conflict with russia, vulnerability to advanced ground-based threats would constrain the roles of most fourth-generation and so-called fourth-generation-plus platforms,” says the report. “as long as an extensive [integrated-air defence] threat persisted, more advanced platforms such as the rafale or eurofighter could theoretically perform strike missions inside the threat zone in conjunction with fifth-generation platforms, although this approach could yield unacceptable attrition.”', 'but with fourth-generation fighters likely still to make up 70% of european nato air forces by 2030, the alliance needs to find ways to make better use of the aircraft.', 'the fast jets could be used to launch long-range missile strikes from beyond the range of russia’s surface-to-air missiles. and, if upgraded with active electronically scanned array (aesa) radars, european fourth-generation fighters would be more capable on defence. aesa radars can detect, track and identify more targets, faster and at much longer distances, notes rand.', '“the resultant situational awareness and ability to defeat multiple threats at the same time makes an aesa capability essential for aspects of high-intensity operations—for example, to intercept cruise missiles,” says the think tank report. “the french decision to procure aesa [for the rafale fighter] is informed by the opportunity to provide a 50% increase in detection range, including of low-observable targets, and maximize the value of new weapon systems such as the meteor beyond visual range missile.”', 'the mbda meteor is an active radar guided beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile that is reported to have a reach of 54nm (100km). in theory, if a fourth-generation fighter like the rafale has an aesa radar and is armed with a beyond-visual-range missile like the meteor it ought to be able to see and hit incoming russian aircraft, while staying out of reach itself.', 'however, beside the addition of aesa on the rafales, other european fourth-generation aircraft lack the advanced radar.', '“uncertainties remain as to which nations will invest in aesa radar technology, advanced and long-range munitions, and secure communication links, among other important capabilities,” says rand. “the degree to which european air forces acquire these technologies will directly impact their ability to contribute to the range of combat air missions expected in a high-intensity conflict.”', 'for its part, the uk royal air force announced in september plans to add the ecrs mk2 aesa radar to 40 examples of its tranche 3 production-standard typhoons, with initial operational capability targeted for 2025.', 'ultimately, to make the most of a mixed fleet of fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft nato will need to invest in communications technologies to link the jets, as well as training exercises to practice coordinating the combat aircraft.', 'f-35’s can communicate among themselves with their multifunction advanced data link (madl), a low probability of intercept communications link. rand points to a fourth and fifth generation fighter operating concept called “combat intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (isr) mode” described by justin bronk of the royal united services institute think tank.', '“in the ‘combat isr’ mode, a four-ship flight of f-35s connected by madl generates situational awareness and shares targeting data with legacy platforms that can then fire their payloads from outside the range of the most capable of the enemy’s air defences,” explains rand. the fourth- and fifth-generation combat aircraft would communicate and pass targeting information with the link 16 system, adds the report.', 'however, this might be a vulnerability point. “it is reasonable to assume that the russian military would seek to disrupt this synergy during a conflict, particularly in light of recent russian investments in ew capabilities,” rand says.', 'still, european nato militaries are getting more practice with the f-35. “already, allies have undertaken initial steps to establish common tactics, techniques, and procedures for incorporating fifth-generation assets into combined operations through targeted exercises as well as preliminary synthetic training systems that link fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft,” the think tank says.', 'one of the highest hurdles to nato collaboration might be investment in aircraft readiness. “to be operationally relevant during a theatre conflict, nato’s air forces must maintain a sufficient number of available aircraft, munitions, and aircrew,” says rand. “currently, most european air forces maintain around half of their existing fleets or less at mission-capable status, with some allies falling below that mark.”', 'what’s more, many fourth-generation aircraft are suffering from “rising maintenance costs from platform age, operational wear and tear resulting from a high operational tempo, and challenges associated with spare parts pipelines serve as significant constraints to aircraft availability”, says the report.', 'the new f-35 also has teething problems, including its autonomic logistics information system, a support system that is so troubled that it has to be replaced across the worldwide fleet.', 'rand recommends a number of solutions to nato aircraft readiness problems including making public data on mission capable rates. it also suggests “public agreement by nato leaders on standard availability objectives could provide renewed political and budgetary focus on efficient and adequately funded maintenance and sustainment”.', 'ultimately, rand concludes that the growing number of stealth aircraft in europe means the “trend lines lead in the right direction”.', '“with additional budgetary and policy attention to increasing readiness, european allies have the opportunity to significantly enhance combat airpower over the coming decade,” says the think tank.', 'the dod had expressed confidence as recently as august that

consists of doubling down on the moral high ground. rooted in the ‘end of history’ thinking of the 1990s, this policy seeks to influence russia through criticism. it emphasises conditionality, treats dialogue as a reward, and resorts to symbolic acts – such as public displays of solidarity with pro-democracy forces and, of course, well-crafted speeches.', 'competing with it is the french theory, embodied by president emmanuel macron’s attempts at outreach to russia. this is rooted in classical realpolitik balancing – the notion that, to avoid being crushed between the united states and china, europe needs to engage in some rapprochement with russia, regardless of our normative differences and moscow’s weak democratic credentials. in day-to-day politics, this view is expressed in efforts to make russia come round to europe’s – or sometimes just france’s – position.', 'and, lingering somewhat sadly on the sidelines, there is the german theory. rooted in what academics would label liberal interdependence and confirmed by germany’s experience of unification, this theory assumes that cooperation and dialogue eliminate differences and lead to normative convergence. germany’s theory was dealt an early blow in 2011 – when vladimir putin’s return to the russian presidency showed that normative convergence had not happened – and it largely crashed after russia’s invasion of ukraine in 2014. still, up until last summer, germany has been looking for topics on which it could engage with russia, in the hopes that keeping the lines of communication open would have some good effects and help make the world a safer place.', 'none of these approaches has worked recently. this is because, in a world in flux, moscow sees them all as fleeting theoretical constructs that are not fit to invest in, let alone build on. russian policymakers dismiss the lithuanian theory as a fantasy based on past dreams: moscow does not believe in the normative framework that forms its basis and, if it did, would fight against it.', 'the french theory goes nowhere because moscow does understand who macron speaks for: himself, france, or europe. moscow sees his ideas as unrealistic and domestically driven. and, in any case, russia has no intention of limiting its freedom of action by prematurely siding with europe, especially given that it does not know whether the european union will become a policy actor to reckon with – or even if it is here to stay.', 'russia’s scepticism about europe may also explain the dismal fate of the german theory. moscow has recently allowed its disputes with berlin to pile up in ways that may cost it its best european friend – apparently just because it does not care to save or invest in a relationship with germany and, by implication, europe.', 'the us election result will affect the relative standing of these theories. a biden win might embolden the lithuanian theory, put the french theory on the defensive, and, depending on the circumstances, lend new energy to germany’s attempts to create patches of common ground in the west’s otherwise normatively adversarial relationship with russia (not to be confused with appeasement, which is a different thing entirely). proponents of each theory would seek to strengthen it by coordinating and cooperating with a biden administration, and they would want to help the new president succeed using their favoured approach (which would be different from trump’s). but, even so, moscow would likely remain reluctant to buy into any of this.\xa0', 'this is not to say that it does not matter to russia who

this view. it would show the kremlin that the normative ideas that have underpinned the western policies are not dead; that they might make a comeback and, importantly, adapt to new realities. but adaptation cannot be taken for granted, and would inevitably take time. so, in either case, moscow will continue to see us policies as provisional – as a part of a temporary phase that one needs to wait out, to see what follows. moscow would view trump as a destroyer of the liberal system – and would welcome this – but not as an architect of a new system that it could engage with. and moscow would inevitably suspect a biden presidency of being just the last gasp of the former liberal consensus.', 'the more biden urged a restoration of obama-era policies – not to mention those of the clinton era – the more moscow would see his actions as the death throes of a dying order and, as such, something to resist or ignore. conversely, the stronger biden proved in acknowledging that the world had changed, and that western policy needed to change too, the more seriously moscow would take him as a figure who could shape the future.', 'the task is to find a way of shaping the world –

aspects of your activities and russian-american relations. so please tell us about the initiative regarding the hermitage foundation and hermitage state museum.', ' well, thank you, konstantin. it’s a pleasure to be talking about something is as exciting and as important as this program. i have to say we were [talking] at the outset about how covid has impacted the world since we last saw each other at the beginning of this year in january. among other things, it’s prevented me from going to st. petersburg in my first 10 or 11 months as ambassador, which i was looking forward to. i haven’t been there since 1988. and i was looking forward to visiting the hermitage, among other things.', 'so you’ve referenced this grant that we’ve made through the ambassadors fund for cultural preservation to support the hermitage. and i can give you a little bit a little bit of detail on that. the project is actually a partnership among four organizations. there’s this ambassador’s fund for cultural preservation, which is part of the state department’s bureau of educational and cultural affairs. that’s one. and then there’s our role at the u.s. embassy. and you mentioned the hermitage foundation, which is based in new york city. and then finally, there’s the state hermitage museum in st. petersburg. and among all four of these, these organizations, we came together to come up with a project to restore three frescoes of the raphael school as part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the death of raphael.', 'and that’s what we’re focused on. these frescoes were painted between 1523 and 1524, on the wall of a villa in italy, and they were actually acquired by the hermitage in 1860. but over the past 500 years, the frescoes have suffered considerable exposure to the elements and prior restoration efforts were imperfect. so the program that we’re sponsoring, is to restore those frescoes which is urgently needed. and as i say it’s done in connection with the 500th anniversary of raphael’s death. and we’re hopeful that after they’re restored, that there will be really an unveiling of the true beauty of the frescoes not just to the russian public, but to the world. which is, you know, the hermitage museum is, of course, a cultural treasure of russia, but really, of the world. i mean, the hermitage is such a – literally – a treasure of art and culture.', 'so with this grant we’re doing, the program is done – we’ve been working with the executive director of the hermitage foundation and i want to credit her, saranna biel-cohen [working] on behalf of the foundation, and of course the director of the hermitage museum, mikhail piotrovsky. i want to credit them for their hard work on this project. and next week on october 28, the foundation, the museum, and myself, the embassy, will have a virtual launch of the project, and anybody, any of your readers or you, if you’re interested, it’ll be at 5pm on wednesday, the 28th. and we’ll learn more about the frescoes, how they’ll be restored, and the cultural significance.', ' very good. and could you say a couple of words about this ambassador’s fund for cultural preservation? as i understand it is a deliberate foundation to preserve treasures cultural treasures throughout the world.', ' yes, indeed, it was established, [nineteen] years ago [in 2001]. it’s a program that’s operated in over 100 countries. and it’s managed out of the state department in washington. and there is a process to review proposals and get approval from the department of state to provide the funding. so this program that we submitted on behalf of the hermitage foundation and the hermitage, was in a competition against hundreds of other proposals from other u.s. embassies worldwide. and the fact that this project won this grant is a sign both of the significance of the project itself, and of the cultural partnership between the united states and russia. and this will be i think, the [seventh] project that we have funded in russia over the last 20 years or so. so it’s an important sign of the cultural bonds between the united states and russia', ' very good. you’re lucky that you prepared the good papers. and we are lucky, of course, russians that this will be restored. and may i ask you some questions about other cultural people to people, so to say, relations between russia and america, like sisters cities program, or the u.s.-russia business cooperation, or cooperation in space, arctic, because there are a lot of dimensions of coexistence, rather only all the military and strategic ones.', ' well, konstantin, you’re absolutely right. and i would say, you know, there are relations between the u.s. government and the government of the russian federation, whether it’s on strategic and military issues, political issues, and we all know how fraught those relations have been over the last several years in particular. but there’s a much broader relationship between the united states and russia between our peoples, including cultural and educational exchanges, in business, in space, in the arctic, and a small topic that i like to emphasize, but my colleagues here at the embassy are probably sick of hearing me talk about – ice hockey – which is a personal interest of mine. but it’s those connections, i think, konstantin that are among the most significant that we have. and they are a bond that keeps us together, when the political situation seems most dire. and one thing i’ve observed in my tenure here is how much the relationship between the united states and russia has changed, just in my professional lifetime.', 'you know, i came i mentioned earlier in our conversation that i visited st. petersburg in 1988. i was a private u.s. citizen had a great interest in russia and russian history. i visited moscow, what was then leningrad, but i visited the soviet union then, and i visited leningrad, not st. petersburg. and if you think of all that’s happened in our relationship between our two countries over the last 30 to 35 years, how things have changed, the ups and downs, what’s grown has been the cultural, business, all of those ties between our two peoples that have grown dramatically.', 'and that distinguishes this era, from that sort of late soviet era that i grew up in, in the 70s and 80s, when we didn’t have those many ties that keep us together, when the political sea gets choppy. so now, for example, we have more than 1,000 u.s. businesses invested in doing business here in russia. and that means russians and americans working together. it’s not just the bolshoi traveling to new york and performing in new york city, or, you know, an equivalent theatre company coming from the united states and performing here. it is day to day personal interaction between colleagues in business. and that’s significant. and it provides a little more ballast for the relationship, when, as i say, the political seas, can get choppy.', 'but as those of us who are old enough, with some perspective, can look back over the last three or four decades and see how our relationship has changed. our counterparts 20 or 30 years from now, the u.s. ambassador and your successor, you know, i’m sure they’ll be remarking too on how much things have changed since 2020. and the relationship between the united states and russia remember those dark old days with, you know, with ukraine – crimea – and syria, and libya, and nagorno-karabakh, and belarus, and election interference and cyber this – and god knows what our successors are going to be talking about 35 years from now. but what i will say is, the fact that we have made the connections that we’ve made over the last 30 or 35 years in business, in the arts, in sports and entertainment, will make it more likely that it’s a positive outcome and more positive developments. not just focused on the day to day negativity.', ' yeah, you mentioned the amazing figure that a thousand u.s. businesses are dealing with russia, despite all the sanctions and all the risks connected with sanctions. and our cooperation between military in syria also exist and they exchange information. so i really share your view that the infrastructure of many, many spheres of interrelations is a good support to these big politics.', ' and part of that, you’re absolutely right, a part of that infrastructure is something you mentioned, konstantin – sister city partnerships. we’ve got a large number. this is a program that’s been in existence for decades, established by and managed by the u.s. government. so there’s an official u.s. government relationship that’s involved here.', '[note: sister cities international is a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) nonprofit which serves as the national membership organization for individual sister cities, counties, and states across the united states. sister cities international was created at president eisenhower’s 1956 white house summit on citizen diplomacy. but it is an independent, nongovernmental organization. end note.]', 'but these sister city relationships, you know, date back into soviet times, into the 1970s when i think the first five sister city relationships happened. and now, you know, we’ve got cities all across the united states that are joined with cities across russia, so sarasota, florida and vladimir, for example. burlington, vermont and yaroslavl, louisville, kentucky and perm, chicago and moscow. and it’s, you know, it’s a small thing, but it’s an important part of our relationship. and, i’d also make the link with business as well, konstantin, because what we’ve done here at the embassy, and my colleagues at the u.s. department of commerce, and our counterparts at the ministry of trade, is that we have made connections, business-to-business connections, with regions and cities in the united states.', 'because of covid, we had to do this virtually, but we were planning a trade mission from texas – texas companies and the government of the state of texas – to the yekaterinburg in the ural region. we had to do it because of covid, we did it virtually, but it was a full day event. the government of the state of texas was involved, the governor of the state himself. and making those types of regional connections for business, i think is a is a profitable way forward. and i’ve spoken to secretary ross, our secretary of commerce, about this. and i know that the secretary himself had a phone call recently with trade minister manturov. and that’s an area where we’re going to continue to pursue making those connections regionally, as well, not just government-to-government.', ' very important, because a lot of asymmetric information is available in regions. people wants to do something, but they lack adequate information. so thank you for that effort in yekaterinburg, because it’s our industrial, i think, number three or number four, city in russian. do you have any plans for cooperation in the arctic because arctic seems to attract attention.', ' yes, it’s a very relevant and timely topic in our relationship, konstantin, because, as you know, russia will take over the chair of the arctic council in just a few months in 2021. and the arctic council is a very important institution that promotes this vital region, as a zone of cooperation free from conflict. and the council itself is an institution where we can discuss sustainable development, the environment, protection and development of indigenous peoples. and it’s a shared interest of the united states, russia – russia, of course, has a huge chunk of the arctic region within its northern border – but the united states, canada, the other members of the countries that border the arctic region, we all have a shared interest in its development and its protection. and so my colleagues in washington and our embassy here have been engaged directly with the russian government, with the ministry of foreign affairs in particular. i met with first deputy foreign minister titov a couple of months ago, to talk about arctic cooperation and russia’s role assuming the chair of the arctic council. and those discussions have continued between our two governments, between washington and moscow, and the pace of interaction will increase as we get closer to 2021 when russia does assume the chair.', 'okay, thank you. and the last question, but our younger audience is always interested about student exchange. and now with covid, a lot of zoom classes may have. but still, what is number of russians which are enrolled in american universities and colleges?', 'well, terrific question. and i could guess, off the top of my head, but what i’m going to propose is that we get back to you with the precise figures for your publication.', '[note: the latest open doors report shows that for the 2018-2019 academic year, more than 5,000 russians studied in the us. we do not have the figures for current enrollment in online programs. end note.]', 'but what i would offer, konstantin, is we had – i participated in a virtual program, that the united states government, that we the embassy helped organize. we usually do it in person, we bring over representatives from colleges and universities in the united states. and they come here to russia, to moscow to other cities, and they’re available to russian families, russian students, parents, who are interested in having a student study in the united states. because of covid, we weren’t able to do that in person. we did it virtually.', 'but here’s the benefit, though, of that, if there’s a silver lining, we got many more u.s. colleges and universities able to participate virtually, who wouldn’t have been able to, to send either afford to or couldn’t send somebody, to participate in a program in in moscow. so what that meant was that the russian students and their families that were interested and participated got a wide variety of much wider variety of u.s. colleges and universities presented and interested in recruiting them to study in the united states. and i know you yourself studied at penn. i won’t embarrass you by saying how many years ago it was, but i was long out of college myself by then. so we’re, neither of us is a youngster anymore. but you yourself can testify to the benefit of study abroad, and getting to know another country, and seeing how their education system works.', 'and i know a number of my colleagues here at the embassy, have studied at russian institutions, russian language, russian culture. so it’s a key component, and has been for a long time, and we’re really looking to, to encourage that. and it’s always fun to meet russians who have studied in the united states and compare notes about their experience, with our expectations. i will say, and these were, these were my remarks, and i wasn’t just trying to flatter the russian participants. it’s a fact that we hear from us colleges and universities, that russian students are among the most desired, are the most serious, hardworking, and just great additions to the student body, which isn’t this surprise for those of us who know or aspire to know, to know russia. it’s an important part of our relationship, the broader relationship between our two peoples. and we certainly want to encourage it, and we’re doing all we can, in the face of the covid pandemic, to make sure that those relationships continue, and that they don’t wither or diminish just because we’re not able to have in person interaction. so my hope is that we’ll have a large number of russian students traveling to the united states and enriching our schools and our campuses as you did in the 80s in philadelphia.', '\xa0thank you. and i, personally, i am very grateful to you for supporting this students’ exchange. because, you know, if you live in the country, it is so difficult to influence you, in pushing any misperceptions, [to engage you in a] witch hunt. and it helps to understand the nature of people. and since 33 years ago, i returned back from philadelphia. you know, i keep this interest towards america i read every day american papers, i read american books, i watch american television, i watched the debate. \xa0tonight i put down notes, who said what, what is the argument of that.', 'and this is something very profound in our sympathy and relations and desire to improve it. because i belong to that part of russian society, and i always openly said at every level that we believe that good relations with america can benefit russian people in medicine, in science, in culture, in sports, in engineering, in business, benefit it. it could be rather selfish from this point of view, but it is beneficial. it’s not hostile. and i wish that you in your position of ambassador put all your efforts, pursue the line in these dark, dark days of covid and the distraction of regular relationships.', ' oh, you’re so right. and i had a great experience a few months ago now. and i can add to all of the categories you listed, law and the legal profession. so i spoke to law students. it was probably a couple of hundred. it was a virtual, a virtual event i did it by zoom or some other electronic means which my colleagues are much better able to describe and make function than i. i just sit in front of the camera and talk. but what was fascinating was, for many of those students, i was the first american that they really had a chance to engage with in their young lives. and we had a lot in common. we talked about our legal education. some of their professors were on the call. and we got to share a few comments about law professors, and what it was like joining a profession, what their expectations were. and it’s just an example in our lives. i know we’ve both experienced this.', 'russians and americans, there are so many things that we have in common, whether we’re engineers, or ballet dancers, or hockey players, or authors, or lawyers. people are people, and the more that we can have these exchanges, trade experiences, explore how our systems are different and how they’re similar. it breaks down stereotypes, and it just makes things between our two countries, makes the relationship stronger, and makes it more difficult for political winds to blow the relationship in a really dangerous direction. the more we understand each other, the better we’ll be able to overcome some of these differences which would separate us now.', 'yeah, thank you, mr. ambassador. do you know what i noticed that what you talked today was actually about the substance of russian-american relations, because usually, a lot of experts view the need of russia to america and vice versa only as a means to solve some others country’s problems, like, we need russia to solve problem in north korea, or in iran, or in afghanistan, or it’s here, but it’s never a table which belongs to us. all spheres, which you mentioned, just belong to russia, and america, in every aspect. and i think it is most valuable in this relation that we have the body of mutual interest. and thank you for understanding that and pursuing this line.', 'well, you’re so right. and it’s not to diminish the importance of those geopolitical issues which i spend, you know, the vast amount of my time focused on and i know you write about, and we’re all interested in, and they’re extremely important to the world and global security and peace and prosperity. but if we’re talking about the united states and russia, it’s not just those issues. and our relationship has a long history. i was joking with the first deputy foreign minister titov, we were we were talking about the arctic. and i commented on the fact that i have to thank russia, then the russian empire, for giving the united states a stake in the arctic by selling us alaska. right?', 'so our relationship goes back a long, long way to when secretary of state seward purchased alaska, and made us a part of eventually the arctic council. but we shared a laugh over that. but it just an example of over time, the united states and russia, we have to deal with each other on these political issues, but on a broader level, people to people, we have stronger ties now than we did when i was growing up in the 60s and 70s, and 80s. people to people ties, educational, and so forth. the political issues are as challenging and maybe even more challenging in some ways than they were for my predecessors 40 or 50 years ago when it was the soviet union versus the west and the united states. but in any event, as long as we keep talking about positive things like this, it will give us more space to try to work out the more difficult political issues as well.', 'thank you very much for this interview and looking forward to talk with you on some other issues, maybe later, because there were a lot of substantial things you conveyed.\xa0 it’s very important for our people, because they’re asymmetrically informed about the positions because they don’t understand how profound is your access to your job and your mission as ambassador here.', 'well, thank you, konstantin. i look forward to continuing this conversation, i hope in person soon but if not, continuing through zoom. so look forward to speaking again soon.', 'end', 'by ', ' | 26

orbit nearly 12,000 miles above earth on saturday.', 'the new satellite joins 24 active navigation spacecraft in the glonass fleet, russia’s analog to the u.s. military’s global positioning system.', 'the mission took off at 3:08:42 p.m. edt (1908:42 gmt) saturday aboard a russian soyuz-2.1b rocket from the plesetsk cosmodrome, a military-run launch base around 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of moscow, according to the russian ministry of defense.', 'liftoff occurred at 10:08 p.m. moscow time.', 'heading southeast from plesetsk, the soyuz rocket shed its four kerosene-fueled boosters around two minutes after liftoff, then jettisoned the aerodynamic shroud covering the glonass satellite after reaching space. the soyuz core stage shut down and separated around five minutes into the mission, followed by ignition of the third stage’s rd-0124 engine.', 'the third stage engine cut off about nine minutes after liftoff, and the mission’s fregat upper stage deployed to begin a series of maneuvers to place the glonass satellite its targeted orbit.', 'the fregat engine ignited three times to place the glonass payload into a circular orbit with\xa0an altitude of more than 11,900 miles (19,100 kilometers) and an inclination of 64.8 degrees. the fregat upper stage released the glonass spacecraft around three-and-a-half hours after liftoff.', 'russian officials said the glonass satellite extended its solar panels, and ground teams established contact with the spacecraft. all systems on-board the satellite were functioning normally after launch saturday, officials said.', 'the payload launched saturday is the third spacecraft in russia’s glonass k series of navigation satellites, which engineers designed\xa0to last longer and transmit more navigation signals. the first two glonass k satellites launched in 2011 and 2014.', 'the glonass k satellites weigh around 2,060 pounds, or 935 kilograms, somewhat less than the earlier generation glonass m satellites.', 'the glonass k satellite is expected to operate for 10 years — an improvement from the seven-year design life of previous satellites — and features five navigation channels, including a new civilian l-band signal. the new craft are lighter, generate more electrical power, and are based on an unpressurized express 1000k bus built by iss reshetnev\xa0in\xa0zheleznogorsk, russia.', 'the glonass k spacecraft will also support the international cospas-sarsat search and rescue network, russian officials said.', 'the satellite launched saturday also uses more russian-built equipment than previous glonass spacecraft, a change introduced to the glonass k design due to international sanctions on russia.', '“replacing the orbital constellation with glonass k spacecraft will ensure the stable operation of the russian navigation system and increase the accuracy of its navigation determinations up to tens of centimeters,” the russian defense ministry said in a statement.', 'as of monday, the glonass fleet consists of 24 active satellites, plus the new spacecraft launched saturday, and three more operating as a spare, undergoing maintenance, and performing fight tests. the network, which is run by the russian military but also used by civilians worldwide, requires 24 satellites in service spread among three orbital planes to provide global navigation coverage.', 'the russian ministry of defense was expected to name the new glonass satellite kosmos 2547, keeping with the naming scheme for russian military spacecraft.'
