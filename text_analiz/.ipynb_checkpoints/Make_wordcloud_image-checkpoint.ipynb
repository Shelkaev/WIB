      "'u.s. presidents george w. bush and barack obama, when first elected, both thought they could establish a rapport with russian leader vladimir putin and dramatically improve u.s.-russian relations.', 'their appraisal of putin swiftly changed.', 'when asked his impression of putin after his first face-to-face meeting, george w. bush said, “i looked the man in the eye. i found him very straightforward and trustworthy – i was able to get a sense of his soul.” obama, eight years later, openly sought a reset in relations only to see his hopes dashed finally with russia’s annexation of the ukrainian peninsula crimea in 2014.', 'joe biden, who as obama’s vice president supported the reset strategy, is unlikely to follow the example of his predecessors, say former diplomats and analysts. biden indicated as much during his presidential campaign, saying at a cnn town hall last month, “i believe russia is an opponent, i really do.”', 'in contrast, he called china “a competitor, a serious competitor.”', 'during the presidential campaign, biden sought to differentiate himself from president donald trump regarding russia, accusing his republican rival of being soft on putin.', 'trump and his aides pushed back, with the president saying in august, “the last person russia wants to see in office is donald trump because nobody’s been tougher on russia than i have.”', 'early last month, biden criticized his opponent for remaining silent on the poisoning of russian opposition leader alexei navalny, which he bluntly blamed on the moscow government.', '“once again, the kremlin has used a favorite weapon — an agent from the novichok class of chemicals — in an effort to silence a political opponent,” he said. “it is the mark of a russian regime that is so paranoid that it is unwilling to tolerate any criticism or dissent.”', 'but candidates can say one thing during a campaign and do something else once in office; sometimes they have little choice because of circumstances or the course of events. will a president joe biden pursue as muscular an approach to russia as he has suggested?', \"“i don't think biden is going to fall head over heels to butter up putin,” said david kramer, who was an assistant secretary of state in the administration of george w. bush. “moscow has continued with a disinformation campaign against him, and so i don't think he's going to extend a hand and say, ‘let's make nice,’” added kramer, now a fellow at the mccain institute, a foreign policy think tank based in washington.\", '“i mean, no reset. i don’t think he’s going to try anything like 2009,” kramer said in reference to obama’s failed reset policy. kramer thinks biden will have to focus largely on domestic issues, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact.', \"“and to the extent he is able to focus on foreign policy, russia should not be at the high end of the priority list,” he told voa. although he added, “you can't ignore it. and it is a factor in a number of problems we face. i think he's going to have to devote his limited time when it comes to foreign policy to work with countries that are ready to solve problems.” by that he means shoring up america’s transatlantic alliance.\", 'biden and putin have met — without much cordiality. in a 2011 interview with ', ' magazine, biden said at one meeting he told the russian leader, “i’m looking into your eyes, and i don’t think you have a soul.”', 'biden continued: “he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said: ‘we understand one another.’”', 'aside from the lack of personal rapport, analysts say any effort to reset relations would be complicated by economic sanctions on russia, imposed by both the obama and trump administrations. the measures will leave biden with little room to maneuver and are unlikely to be lifted while western powers believe russia is mounting cyberattacks against them.', 'former western diplomats say antagonism is likely to persist between washington and moscow as long as the kremlin seeks to undermine western democratic institutions.', 'last week, a former top security adviser to british prime minister boris johnson, mark sedwill, revealed that britain has launched a series of covert cyber-based attacks on russian leaders and their interests to “impose a price greater than one they might have expected” for their cyber-offensive against the west.', 'other allied powers, including the u.s. are doing so, too, say western intelligence officials in what is becoming a “like-for-like” cyber-conflict with the kremlin in the so-called “gray space,” the gap between normal state relations and armed conflict.', 'the u.s. and other western powers are in conflict with russia on a range of issues — from the 2014 annexation of crimea to the pro-moscow agitation in east ukraine, from russia’s backing of syria’s president bashar al-assad to the 2018 attempted assassination in salisbury, england, of former russian double agent sergei skripal.', 'heather williams of britain’s chatham house expects a biden administration to focus on two key areas: restoring arms control and strengthening nato to check russian adventurism.', '“on the one hand, the u.s. must maintain a strong deterrent and restore credibility with its allies. at the same time, it must pursue arms control and other risk reduction opportunities,” she said.', 'in the final days of the presidential election the kremlin appeared to be hedging its bets on who might win.', 'republican campaigners, as well as president trump, had been hurling corruption charges at biden’s son hunter over his service on the board of an energy company in ukraine and business dealings with china.', 'but putin dodged an opportunity to amplify the allegations against hunter biden, saying, “yes, in ukraine he had or maybe still has a business. it doesn’t concern us. it concerns the americans and the ukrainians. i don’t see anything criminal about this.”', 'the russian leader has also sought to highlight possible common ground with biden — especially over nuclear arms control.', 'putin called this month for the last existing nuclear arms control pact between russia and the u.s. to be saved, proposing to extend the new start treaty that’s set to expire in february. “it would be extremely sad if the treaty ceases to exist,” he said.', 'the treaty was signed in 2010 by barack obama and then-russian president dmitry medvedev. the pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.', 'during his long career in the senate, biden was a champion of nuclear arms control and he has promised to seek to extend the new start treaty, saying he would likely accept a russian offer to extend it for five years.']['\\n', '\\n', 'as a candidate, joe biden said he would reverse many of the foreign-policy initiatives of the trump administration, such as withdrawing the united states from international agreements, and work to repair the transatlantic relationship that he contends has been the key to stability in europe over the past 75 years.', 'he has said he would take a tougher stand on russia, expressed strong support for ukraine, and would rejoin the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran, if tehran holds up its end of the deal.', 'a former vice president and senator who served nearly 50 years in washington, biden believes the united states can best tackle global threats by leading alliances of democratic states.', 'he said he would take \"immediate steps\" upon entering office to strengthen alliances \"and once more have america lead the world.\"', 'however, biden will be faced with major domestic problems in a deeply divided country -- including the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, racial tension, and growing inequality -- that may prompt him to put his foreign-policy initiatives on the back burner, analysts say.', 'analysts have said it could take the biden administration several months to put together its entire foreign policy team and set more specific priorities.', 'biden has said he would seek to repair transatlantic ties, which he asserts president donald trump has damaged by repeatedly criticizing the european union and nato, slapping tariffs on some european goods, and withdrawing from international agreements.', 'in contrast to trump, who in 2016 called nato \"obsolete,\" biden has called it the \"most effective political-military alliance in modern history\" and said it must remain strоng while adapting to new kinds of threats from russia.', '\"to counter russian aggression, we must keep the alliance\\'s military capabilities sharp while also expanding its capacity to take on nontraditional threats, such as weaponized corruption, disinformation, and cybertheft,\" he wrote in the journal ', ' earlier in 2020, in an article setting out his positions on a range of issues.', 'biden has said he would take a tougher stand against russian president vladimir putin, and has called moscow an \"opponent\" as well as the biggest \"threat\" to the security of the united states today.', 'he has criticized the kremlin for actions including the seizure of crimea and for its role in the war between kyiv and russia-backed separatists in ukraine’s donbas region. he has also accused it of interfering in u.s. elections and of being behind attacks on russian journalists and civil society leaders. trump rarely criticized the kremlin.', '\"unlike trump, i\\'ll defend our democratic values and stand up to autocrats like putin,\" biden said in a tweet in august.', \"he has also threatened to punish moscow if it interfered in the 2020 election and rejected trump's idea of inviting russia back into the group of seven (g7) leading industrialized countries.\", '\"we must impose real costs on russia for its violations of international norms and stand with russian civil society, which has bravely stood up time and again against...putin\\'s kleptocratic authoritarian system,\" he wrote in the foreign affairs article.', 'biden supports the cancelation of the kremlin-backed nord stream 2 pipeline to carry natural gas from russia to germany. opponents of the pipeline say it would deprive ukraine of significant transit fees from russia and increase european reliance on russian energy exports.', \"biden, who was obama's point man on ukraine as vice president, has expressed strong support for ukraine's independence and integration with europe and has backed sending lethal weapons to kyiv to help it battle the russian-backed separatists.\", \"biden has said he would extend new start, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with russia, while pursuing negotiations on a new pact. new start, which imposes limits on the two countries' strategic nuclear arsenals, expires in february but can be extended by up to five years by mutual agreement.\", \"the trump administration has rejected moscow's proposal to prolong new start with no additional conditions, as well as an offer for a one-year extension, and has not reached an agreement on its extension. biden argues that the pact is beneficial to u.s. security and should be extended while a new agreement is sought.\", \"while biden's positions on putin and russia's actions suggest that tensions between washington and moscow will remain tense and could potentially worsen once he takes office, arms control is one of a handful of issues that analysts say could present a platform for productive negotiations between the united states and the kremlin. \", 'biden has said that he would have the united states rejoin the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran, which curbed the country’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief -- if tehran moves back into compliance with its terms.', \"iran violated the terms of the agreement with global powers after trump withdrew the united states from the deal known as the jcpoa in 2018 and imposed sanctions on tehran. the sanctions have hurt iran's economy but not promoted it to seek a new deal.\", 'biden has said he would work with the other powers involved -- britain, france, germany, russia, and china, as well as the eu -- to amend aspects of the agreement once iran is back in compliance.', '\"with our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal\\'s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern,\" such as human rights violations and the jailing of foreigners, biden said.', 'biden said he would bring u.s. troops home from afghanistan -- almost 20 years after the united states led an invasion to drive the taliban extremist group from power following the september 11 attacks in 2001 -- and leave in place only a small contingent of special forces who would carry out counterterrorism missions.', 'biden opposed the large buildup of u.s. troops in afghanistan while serving as vice president from 2009 to 2017.', 'barring substantial developments before his inauguration on january 20, he will inherit a historic but fragile peace process that the trump administration set in motion by reaching a political deal with the taliban in february 2020 that paved the road for peace talks between the militants and the u.s.-backed afghan government.', 'biden has said he will work with u.s. allies to strengthen democracies around the world and push back on creeping authoritarianism. he has expressed concern over what is widely seen as a rollback of democracy in some nato member states, including poland and hungary.', '\"during my first year in office, the united states will organize and host a global \\'summit for democracy\\' to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the free world. it will bring together the world\\'s

adapted their strategies to deal with the new environment. russia’s increased efforts have had decidedly mixed results.', 'three factors were evident when the soviet union collapsed and continue today, narrowing russian policy options in the region.', 'armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia are all radically different, with varying attitudes toward russia and moscow’s rule throughout the imperial and soviet eras. for centuries, armenia has sought russia’s protection against turkey and iran, which ruled most of the armenian historic homelands.', ' this security concern was paramount in the immediate aftermath of the soviet collapse: the soviet army had disappeared, leaving the turkish third army as the most potent military force in the wider region. for its part, post-soviet russia views armenia as its closest friend in the region. a large and influential armenian diaspora in russia has maintained those positive feelings.', 'azerbaijani elites, russified by the oil boom of the late nineteenth century, have largely been friendly to russia. thanks to former president heydar aliyev—who rose through the ranks of the soviet kgb and neither feared nor hated the post-soviet rulers of russia—a generally positive attitude toward russia survived the nationalisms of the years immediately following the soviet collapse. though post-soviet russia was initially suspicious of the expansion of turkish and western influence in azerbaijan, russia has since forged close energy relations with turkey. in the early period, these commercial relations took precedence in the russia-turkey relationship. more recently, as detailed later in the paper, the increasing ambiguity of russian-turkish relations has complicated russia’s relations with azerbaijan.', 'armenia and azerbaijan have incorporated friendly relations with russia into a wider strategy: former armenian foreign minister vartan oskanian described it as a multivectoral approach, in which “foreign policy vectors point in different directions.”', ' it entails seeking close relations with and assistance from powers other than russia, primarily the united states and the european union (eu). large armenian diasporas in the united states and france have aided this endeavor. in contrast, a poor record on democracy and human rights, as well as the armenian diaspora’s efforts in the united states, have hobbled azerbaijan. in the united states, congressional legislation blocked most assistance to azerbaijan until waiver authority was granted in 2001 in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks and azerbaijan’s subsequent role in assisting u.s. antiterrorism efforts elsewhere.', 'in georgia, nationalism remains centered on the rejection of russia. since the massacre of unarmed civilians by soviet troops in the capital, tbilisi, in 1989 and the post-independence presidency of former soviet dissident—and extreme nationalist—zviad gamsakhurdia, georgian society has generally come to view russia as a usurping occupier. february 25—the day the red army invaded tbilisi in 1921—is still observed annually as soviet occupation day. georgians explain away decades of fawning over the “occupiers” as one ambassador did: “for all those years that the russians ruled us, we told them we loved them. and they actually believed us.” georgian warlords deposed gamsakhurdia in january 1992 and installed former soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze as a weak figurehead. his tenure as president involved a constant renegotiation of his powers to gain ascendancy over those warlords. in the early 1990s, still at his weakest vis-à-vis the warlords and pressured by russian support for abkhaz and ossetian separatism, he tried to harness, not reverse, the extreme nationalism of his predecessor’s supporters, especially those displaced from abkhazia by russian-backed separatists.', 'for their part, russians have acted as emotionally as the georgians, seeing georgia’s aspirations toward the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) and the eu as the betrayal of its once advantageous position within moscow’s empire. during one regularly occurring period of heightened tensions, a normally calm senior russian diplomat asked, “when the soviet union was ruled by people named jughashvili, orjonikidze, and beria, just who was occupying whom?” after the september 11, 2001, attacks, as u.s. troops were arriving in georgia to train georgians in counterterrorism, an embittered russian general, recalling the old times of russian officers’ warm reception in georgia over countless song-and-wine-filled ', ' banquets, said, “the americans think they will teach the georgians to fight. in reality, the georgians will teach the americans to sing.”', 'russia cannot deal with armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia in isolation because the countries’ own relations with one another are dense and fraught with tension and conflict. most salient is the karabakh conflict, over which armenians and azerbaijanis have shed so much blood since 1987. both sides appeal to russia for support and view russian amity toward the other side as a betrayal. in the early years, russia tried to profit from the conflict, clandestinely providing weaponry and mercenaries to both sides. in 1992 and 1993, russians backed two coups to install puppets in azerbaijan, but both backfired. in 1992, former azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov’s attempt to return from moscow was thwarted by the nationalist azerbaijan popular front. and in 1993, surat huseynov’s revolt against the popular front was hijacked by aliyev, who took power for himself alone.', ' thereafter, russia stepped back in the region. since brokering a ceasefire in the karabakh conflict in 1994, moscow has limited its interventions to trying (unsuccessfully) to get the sides to agree to a russia-led peacekeeping force of the sort moscow installed to control the abkhazia, south ossetia, and transdniestria separatist conflicts. russia remains a supplier of weaponry to both sides, and every major arms sale to one provokes protests from the other. because azerbaijan’s oil revenues expanded, it has been able to diversify its defense procurements, but armenia remains dependent on russia for arms and security guarantees.', 'georgia is closely intertwined with both armenia and azerbaijan. there are large armenian and azerbaijani minorities in georgia (in separatist abkhazia, armenians actually outnumber the abkhaz). despite initial nationalist difficulties in borchaly, an azerbaijani-inhabited section of georgia, georgian-azerbaijani relations have been good almost since georgia’s independence—largely thanks to a reconciliation of convenience between two soviet-era rivals, eduard shevardnadze and heydar aliyev. aliyev needed georgia to enable the western transit of azerbaijan’s hydrocarbon exports and the import of western goods from turkey. shevardnadze needed azerbaijan to secure oil and gas pipelines to provide both transit royalties and strategic importance to the west.', ' he also needed aliyev to help ensure that the large azerbaijani population of georgia reliably voted for shevardnadze’s political grouping, the citizens union.', 'georgian-armenian relations have been trickier. a portion of the armenian population in georgia is concentrated in javakheti, near a large soviet (later russian) military base that fueled the region’s economy until it was closed in 2007. from 1992 to 1993, the javakhk armenians sought independence, apparently with russian encouragement. but armenia’s only transit routes to russia and the west lay through georgia, as the karabakh conflict had closed armenia’s borders with turkey and azerbaijan, so the government of then armenian president levon ter-petrosyan tamped down javakhk separatism. relations between the two countries grew closer after mikheil saakashvili came to the presidency in georgia in 2004, and they have remained friendly under subsequent leaders.', 'to this day, russian policy in the south caucasus is intertwined with the north caucasus—to which russia has devoted the blood and treasure of generations and which post-soviet russia sees as key to the integrity of the russian state. russia’s domestic security concerns have intruded on the south caucasus in a number of areas.', 'as russian power ebbed away at the end of the soviet era, the russian army—for the first time in centuries—no longer wielded the decisive force in the region. the turkish third army was the most powerful military in the region, and locals adapted to the strategic effects. russia threw its diminished resources into the caucasus to suppress the first chechen rebellion—and met defeat. russia’s subsequent remilitarization of the region, and its demands to adapt the conventional armed forces in europe treaty to allow for greater freedom of movement in the flank, stemmed from its perceived need to redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence in the region.', ' to address russia’s moves to adapt the treaty, azerbaijan and georgia allied with moldova and ukraine to form what later solidified into the organization for democracy and economic development (known simply as the guam).', 'ossetians, ethno-linguistically and religiously different from their neighbors, have been russia’s principal allies in the north caucasus for two centuries. as russia dealt with a host of ethnic nationalisms in the first years after the soviet collapse, including chechen separatism and later an armed islamist movement, north ossetia gained strategic importance to, and leverage with, russian leadership. it has used that leverage to ensure robust russian support for south ossetian separatism from georgia.', 'likewise, other ethnic groups in the mountains of the north caucasus (for example, the chechens, kabardians, and cherkes) saw in abkhaz separatism from georgia the validation of their own ethnic nationalisms. with russian facilitation, many so-called volunteers made their way to abkhazia to join the separatist war against georgia from 1992 to 1993. among the most effective of these was the chechen shamil basayev, who was later an archnemesis of the russians but their ally in that struggle.', 'during the second chechen war, fighters and their families took refuge in georgia’s pankisi gorge, which was effectively outside the georgian government’s control. russian president boris yeltsin called shevardnadze in november 1999 to demand the reinstatement of russian border troops in georgia and passage for russian military units through georgia to attack pankisi from the south. shevardnadze stalled and then called on the americans to dissuade yeltsin. later, after the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the united states sent troops to train the georgians to restore security in pankisi, forestalling russian actions there. even worse, from the russian point of view, shevardnadze made a deal with ruslan gelayev, a chechen commander sheltering in the pankisi gorge, to launch an attack on abkhaz-held territory in 2001. the attack failed, but the russian authorities viewed this series of events as proof that georgia was treacherous and untrustworthy.', 'lastly, azerbaijan shares a long border and considerable ethnic overlap with russia’s dagestan autonomous republic, where salafist proselytizing made extensive inroads in the 1990s. after some years, a full-fledged islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked up with the remains of the armed chechen nationalist movement, which also fell under salafist influence. when attacks began on authorities in dagestan, security cooperation with azerbaijan gained importance for russian internal security.', 'the stage was thus set early on for a consistent—even static—russian policy toward the south caucasus: an economy-of-force balancing act to preserve russia’s traditional friendship and strategic alliance with armenia without harming russia’s economic and security relationship with azerbaijan; and a constant, emotional, and ever-deepening hostility toward georgia.', 'russia views the international arena as a series of camps, each centered by a power whose greatness is confirmed by possessing a camp.', ' russia has been keen to ensure that the new nations forged out of former soviet republics remain in its camp and has formed multinational institutions to cement those relations.', 'initially, russia had hopes that the commonwealth of independent states (cis), formed when the soviet union broke up, might fill the bill. azerbaijan and armenia joined the cis at its inception in 1991. but it was not until 1993 that georgia’s president shevardnadze—under russian military pressure in support of abkhaz separatism and facing a rebellion by ousted former president gamsakhurdia—reluctantly acceded. in 2008, georgia withdrew from the cis after the country’s defeat in the russo-georgian war. with the cis having little influence, russia put forward two other institutions to accomplish the task.', 'the collective security treaty, originally signed in 1992, became the collective security treaty organization (csto) in 2002, designed as a counterweight to nato. armenia joined to relieve its security concerns with regard to turkey; azerbaijan and georgia did not.', 'the eurasian customs union, officially formed in 2000 but active from 2010 onward, also included armenia but not azerbaijan or georgia. in 2014, russia turned the customs union into the eurasian economic union (eaeu), intended as a mirror image of the eu. moscow’s ongoing attempts to equate the two organizations on the international stage has had significant effects on the caucasus, as noted later in this paper.', 'azerbaijan was able to avoid joining russia’s so-called camp thanks to its independent oil revenues, which have grown for both azerbaijan and other post-soviet caspian littoral states. in the early 1990s, moscow’s ability to project power was low and russia could only protest ineffectually when littoral countries signed hydrocarbon extraction contracts in the absence of an international agreement to define national rights in the caspian.', ' azerbaijan, kazakhstan, and turkmenistan brought in western energy majors without fearing russia’s reaction (azerbaijan signed its first major contract in 1993). the status of the caspian was not codified even preliminarily until 2018, and to this day, no treaty covers exploitation of the seabed.', ' russia could not fight ’em, so it joined ’em, settling for sharing in the profits from hydrocarbon development and transit.', 'for a time in the mid-1990s, the united states and russia maneuvered against one another through their respective support of pipelines. the united states heavily promoted the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc) pipeline as an alternative to a russian monopoly on hydrocarbon transit to the west. however, u.s. doctrine demanded that the pipeline be commercially viable in its own right, and the united states refused to put resources into boosting that viability. recognizing this, russia banked on the oil majors’ desire to save money by transporting the oil by tanker across the black sea and through the turkish straits. but when then bp chair john browne visited istanbul and inspected the narrow bosphorus passage, he decided the route was too risky and threw the weight of the oil majors behind btc.', 'russia’s closest relationship in the south caucasus remains with armenia, the country most firmly entrenched in russia’s camp. it is frequently called a strategic alliance, and for armenia this is certainly the case as 3,000 russian troops based in its second-largest city, gyumri, form a trip wire against turkish military action.', 'while azerbaijan generally deals with other countries transactionally, another criterion takes precedence: their stance on armenia and the karabakh conflict. this is the trickiest situation for russia to manage: azerbaijan is russia’s largest trading partner in the caucasus, the two countries have important common issues regarding hydrocarbons, and russia sees a strategic aim in keeping azerbaijan out of what it calls the western camp. therefore, while supporting armenia, russia has tried to avoid alienating azerbaijan, including during the recent surge in fighting. until 2010, russia was discreet about its arms sales to armenia to avoid provoking azerbaijan, denying reports of large arms transfers when they surfaced in 2009.', ' more recently, russia has started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry to both sides and has been more open about its balancing. for example, in 2010, russia signed a new lease on its military base in gyumri (extending it to 2044) and agreed to sell s-300 surface-to-air missiles to azerbaijan.', 'as part of this balancing, russia is involved in attempts to mediate between azerbaijan and armenia to resolve the karabakh conflict. since 1995, russia has been a co-chair of the minsk group, a body under the aegis of the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce) and composed of a number of countries interested in brokering peace. in 1997, the united states and france joined russia as co-chairs, and the three countries have conducted all negotiations thereafter without significant input from the other group members. this structure has facilitated russia-west cooperation to keep a politically insoluble problem from flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline states. when dmitry medvedev was president of russia (2008–2012), he poured great efforts into russian peace initiatives, and with french and u.s. assent russia came to dominate the process. as part of this campaign, medvedev also supported the 2008 opening between armenia and turkey, azerbaijan’s closest ally. that rapprochement failed, however, due to opposition from key constituencies on both sides. ultimately, azerbaijan and armenia were not interested in a negotiated solution, and medvedev’s initiative foundered.', 'russia’s relations with georgia quickly went into a downward spiral after the soviet collapse. russia used substantial military force to ensure the survival and then victory of the separatist rebellion in abkhazia and leveraged that and a revolt by gamsakhurdia to force shevardnadze to accept a russian peacekeeping force in western georgia. still hostile, russia backed two attempts, in 1995 and 1998, to assassinate shevardnadze. until the latter attempt, shevardnadze had been trying to play russia and the united states off against each other, but these actions drove shevardnadze squarely into the arms of the united states.', 'the russians loathed shevardnadze for his role in the collapse of the soviet bloc—on one television program, he was reviled as “the ostap bender of the soviet union,” after the con-man protagonist of the classic soviet comic novel ', '. but that feeling paled beside the emotions stoked in the russian leadership by the flamboyant and mercurial mikheil saakashvili, who ousted shevardnadze at the end of 2003 and became president in 2004. in that year, saakashvili also ousted the quasi-independent aslan abashidze from his rule over the autonomous batumi region, which housed a russian military base. also in 2004, tensions flared in south ossetia. russia retaliated over the next few years, banning the import of georgian products, banning flights between russia and georgia, closing the land border between the two countries, and launching an aggressive campaign against ethnic georgians in russia, including russian citizens, their businesses, and their families. in 2007, russia closed off most of north ossetia to foreigners, allowing preparations for war to proceed unseen by the outside world. and in 2008, as tensions flared again in south ossetia, russian troops invaded, defeating georgia’s forces in short order, occupying parts of georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia, and incorporating these conquests into the separatist statelets, which russia shortly thererafter recognized as independent.', ' but the war also brought the expansion of a new competitor’s presence: the small, neutral osce mission was scrapped, and a large new eu monitoring mission was put in its place.', ' despite the limitations placed on that mission, the overall eu presence and commitment sharply increased.', 'putin’s return to the presidency in 2012 came with a more assertive foreign policy. new leaders wholly dependent on russia were installed in the separatist entities russia supported, including south ossetia and abkhazia, replacing long-established leaders who were pro-russian but possessed their own independent power bases. more importantly, russia began to treat the european union—not just nato—as a strategic rival intent on taking over parts of what medvedev had called russia’s sphere of “', '.” five years earlier, that view had been restricted to the ', ', or senior officers of the hard power ministries (primarily the military, internal affairs, and security services); after putin’s return to the presidency, it became russia’s official policy.', 'the ukrainian crisis of 2013–2014 began with putin pressuring both ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and armenian president serzh sargsyan into repudiating the eu association agreements they had signed and instead joining the nascent russia-centric eaeu. the pressure on sargsyan included a putin visit to azerbaijan’s capital, baku, to discuss arms sales. yanukovych’s caving to putin’s pressure triggered the revolution of dignity in ukraine and his eventual downfall. sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequences. he explained to the nation that security concerns necessitated joining the russian-led organization—that only russia could safeguard armenia from its neighbors. however, after rejecting the eu, sargsyan immediately tried to placate it. negotiations eventually restarted on a trade agreement, and in 2017, armenia signed a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with the eu.', 'after a few protests, armenians fell in line with sargsyan’s capitulation to putin’s wishes: they assumed their security expectations would be met and that this change was worth the economic disadvantages of giving up the association with the eu. indeed, when a few months later russia occupied crimea and annexed it after the fig leaf of a controlled referendum, armenians saw this as a model and justification for future annexation of nagornyy karabakh and the surrounding territories. russia’s actions had called into question all territorial dispositions after the soviet collapse, which had been agreed among the union republics, codified in the cis treaty, and endorsed by the international community. with borders now questioned and russia more capable of projecting power, it was better to be a close ally of russia than a potential victim.', 'but in april 2016, armenians suffered a rude awakening. on april 1, azerbaijan began a military operation along the line of contact in karabakh and, over the next four days, managed to regain a few strategic points occupied by the karabakh armenians years before. russia’s reaction was to maintain its balancing act. russian foreign minister sergey lavrov went to the region explicitly to be a neutral mediator. he brought a ceasefire plan and proposed the russian peacekeeping force that had been rejected so many years earlier. that approach did not go over well with the armenian populace. in their view, armenia was a treaty ally of russia and had given up european aspirations to stay in russia’s camp—and, therefore, russia should be on armenia’s side. however, as far as russia was concerned, legally, the combat had nothing to do with armenia but was between nagornyy karabakh and azerbaijan. the armenian people did not see it that way, after being convinced by their leaders over a generation that karabakh and armenia had become a single polity. sargsyan, who initially supported the idea of a russian peacekeeping force, was seen as having sold out armenian interests. he then had to backtrack, putting fatal cracks in his prestige and authority.', 'almost immediately, mutinies and demonstrations broke out, occasionally with a subtle anti-russian flavor. in july 2016, a group of gunmen calling themselves sasna tsrer (“daredevils of sassoun,” from an armenian epic poem) violently took over a police station and held out against government forces for two weeks, demanding sargsyan’s resignation. even after they surrendered, they retained widespread support, which translated into a people fed up with the ruling elite and with russia.', ' other factors—such as a notorious murder by a russian soldier, price hikes by the russian-owned electricity supplier, and continued arms sales to azerbaijan—further exacerbated popular discontent.', 'in 2017, faced with term limits when his presidency was to expire in 2018, sargsyan chose one of the standard post-soviet autocratic solutions to staying in power: establishing a parliamentary system, turning the presidency into a figurehead, and becoming prime minister. sargsyan and his dashnak nationalist allies duly won parliamentary elections in 2017, and a figurehead president was in due course elected in 2018. then the play went off script: the aggrieved populace rose up in demonstrations, and in just over a month, sargsyan was ousted. opposition leader nikol pashinyan was installed as acting prime minister, and new elections affirmed his position later in the year.', 'so far, this scenario resembles one of the “color revolutions” that putin had railed against for the previous fifteen years and had tried to reverse through military force in georgia, syria, and ukraine. but instead of condemning pashinyan (who had sharply criticized russia during the demonstrations) and lending full support to sargsyan (one of putin’s most loyal supporters), putin was remarkably restrained throughout and had a friendly and supportive meeting with pashinyan just days after the latter took power, publicly offering him his congratulations and best wishes.', 'it is possible that russia blamed sargsyan for the anti-russian sentiment following the clashes of april 2016.', ' but it is also clear that pashinyan made efforts to reassure putin, as he—like the entire armenian electorate—understood that russia remained the guarantor of armenia’s security vis-à-vis its much larger neighbors. he also understood that any rift with russia would create a vulnerability that azerbaijan could exploit with regard to karabakh; pashinyan knew he could not afford any daylight between armenia and russia. he left armenia in the eaeu and csto. he made clear that he would pursue a democratic system, but he “also said that he viewed democracy as a firm belief, rather than a geopolitical orientation, making clear the distinction.”', ' perhaps the fact that putin knew this as well, implying no major changes in armenia’s strategic orientation, occasioned his restraint: if there is no threat that armenia will leave its camp, russia can continue balancing its policy toward azerbaijan and armenia.', 'azerbaijan is the type of country with which putin seems to feel comfortable—a stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policies. azerbaijan causes few headaches for russia and demands only that its transactional approach be reciprocated. president ilham aliyev began his rule only three years after putin took over russia; his father heydar aliyev had ruled azerbaijan for a decade before that, not counting the soviet period, when he also ruled the country as his own fiefdom. heydar aliyev’s time in the senior-most ranks of the soviet state, communist party, and security services ', ' made his attitude very different from other post-soviet rulers, some of whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki in soviet times and saw moscow as the source of all power. heydar aliyev treated russia’s post-soviet rulers without the fealty or fear that some of his contemporaries showed.', 'ilham aliyev does not have the experience or ability of his father, but he has inherited that legacy of autonomous sovereignty. if pashinyan intends to show that democracy is a belief, not a geopolitical choice, the aliyevs have long since shown that the same is true of autocracy. azerbaijan and russia have enjoyed a functional, transactional relationship that is cordial, neighborly, and devoid of emotion. to some extent, azerbaijan grew ideologically closer to russia in the wake of the ukraine crisis, as both countries saw themselves as attacked and undermined by a fifth column of western-supported civil society and nongovernmental organizations. in 2014, the chief of azerbaijan’s presidential apparatus—usually considered closest to russia in the azerbaijani leadership—published a long, scathing article outlining that worldview. he even implied that charges of human rights violations against a country only proved that its leadership was defending its sovereignty.', 'but ideological sympathy never overcame azerbaijan’s transactional approach to relations with russia. in 2012, azerbaijan demanded a sharp increase in the rent russia was paying for the soviet-era qabala radar station. the station was part of the soviet and russian strategic early warning system, and therefore the united states favored its continued functioning to help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launches. nonetheless, azerbaijan stuck to its price demands, and the russians eventually closed the station at the end of 2012.', 'apart from its transactional approach, the azerbaijani leadership has a single prism for judging the actions of all other countries: the karabakh conflict. since independence, azerbaijan has rejected virtually all forms of multilateral cooperation involving armenia. that has imposed a durable limit on the extent of rapprochement with russia. for example, azerbaijan has not joined the csto, of which armenia is a member; to do so, it would have to renounce any military solution to the karabakh conflict, and it has been a tenet of faith in azerbaijan that only the credible threat of a military solution can pressure armenia to negotiate seriously. nor has azerbaijan joined the eaeu, as armenia did. joining it could limit azerbaijan’s ability to use its economic leverage to marshal international support on karabakh and counter armenian diaspora influence in the west, particularly in the united states and france.', 'indeed, because russia’s annexation of crimea calls into question the borders of the former soviet republics—which the republics recognize as state borders under the alma-ata declaration of december 21, 1991—it also calls into question the basis for azerbaijani claims to sovereignty over nagornyy karabakh. moreover, for the last fifteen years, proposed principles for a negotiated peace in the karabakh conflict have included a “binding expression of the popular will” as part of the ultimate disposition of the territory.', ' the russia-staged referendum in crimea drove home to the azerbaijanis how easy it is for the power with boots on the ground to ensure its desired outcome in such a vote.', 'all in all, since 2014, azerbaijan has become, if anything, even more transactional in its approach to russia. the 2016 offensive in karabakh, which might earlier have been deterred by reluctance to antagonize russia, can be seen as one example. the fighting azerbaijan initiated on september 27, 2020, can also be seen as a transaction with russia—one made possible by turkish intervention. to be sure, one aim of the offensive is to regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chips from armenia’s side of the board. but perhaps the larger aim is to threaten putin with instability and possibly a region-wide war if he does not force deep concessions on armenia. aliyev ignored lavrov’s initial offer: the return of two provinces, in exchange for russia being allowed to deploy a peacekeeping force.', ' whatever the outcome, it is clear that to azerbaijan, russia is now less of a partner and more of a problem to be solved.', 'azerbaijan tries to solve its russia problem through closer relations with, in particular, turkey and china. turkey has long been azerbaijan’s main advocate in the international sphere. aside from ethnic kinship (a significant azeri population lives in eastern turkey) and deep historical links before the soviet takeover, turkey is quick to cite certain protectorate rights granted under the treaties of moscow and kars (1921). since independence, azerbaijan has seen turkey as a counterweight to russian power. at present, however, turkey has its own complex relations with russia. turkey enjoys the positive effects of continued close energy and pipeline relations, as well as personal interactions between putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan; but offsetting these effects are sharp differences between turkey and russia on the conflicts in syria and libya. azerbaijan seeks to ensure that turkey’s support vis-à-vis russia is unwavering. turkey’s support of azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement in the autumn 2020 fighting have granted azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver vis-à-vis russia—both on the battlefield and with regard to russian mediation efforts. it took the kremlin almost two weeks to arrange a putin-aliyev phone call; a humanitarian truce brokered by lavrov fell apart almost immediately.', 'china has increased its engagement with the caucasus as part of its belt and road initiative, though neither its trade nor investment in the region compare with its far more massive engagement in central asia.', ' its main partner in the region is azerbaijan, which has the largest population, economy, and reserves of natural resources. the partnership makes sense geopolitically as well: although china is now a major trading partner for armenia and georgia, armenia is too dependent on russia to be pried loose and china is probably wary of russian sensitivities on georgia. china has now become the third largest source of imports for azerbaijan, after russia and turkey. azerbaijan presents the most potential for future political rapprochement, and china, unlike the west, is not burdened with concerns over azerbaijan’s human rights record. azerbaijan hopes that as the belt and road initiative progresses, china will increase its use of azerbaijan for the transit of cargo to europe—floating cargo across the caspian and loading it onto the railroad link opened in 2017 between baku and kars, in turkey, via georgia.', 'putin once famously declared that he would hang saakashvili by his testicles.', ' that promise remains unfulfilled, but not for want of trying. saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority in 2012 and was voted out of office in 2013. if putin thought saakashvili’s ouster by the billionaire (and, until shortly before then, russian citizen) bidzina ivanishvili and his georgian dream party would liberate a wellspring of affection for russia, he was in for disappointment. the georgian populace remains deeply suspicious of russia. in late 2014, nato initiated a major assistance program, the substantial nato-georgia package, sharply ramping up security cooperation with the georgian dream government.', 'russia’s hostile and aggressive policy toward georgia, too, remains unchanged. as always, the pressure point between russia and georgia has been separatism, namely the russia-backed polities in abkhazia and south ossetia. in the run-up to putin’s return to the presidency, long-serving local officials in many areas controlled by russia, especially in the russia-supported south ossetia and abkhazia (and transdniestria, outside the region), were ousted, with moscow backing newcomers who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience to putin alone. at the end of 2011, edmund kokoity, who had ruled south ossetia since 2001, was forced to resign from the leadership and was ultimately replaced by leonid tibilov, a veteran of the kgb.', ' in abkhazia, the death of sergei bagapsh in may 2011 triggered a premature power struggle that threw the plans off track; in the elections that followed, moscow’s chosen candidate, raul khajimba, was defeated. however, with the intervention of putin’s fixer vladislav surkov, president alexander ankvab was ousted in june 2014 and khajimba was installed.', 'by then, russia had occupied and annexed crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprisings in donbass, as well as kharkiv and odessa; in response, the west had imposed sanctions. perhaps this left putin and his regime less concerned with placating western opinion, and he moved to annex the separatists in all but name. as early as october 13, 2014—the month after khajimba’s inauguration—russia presented abkhazia with a draft treaty of alliance, integration and partnership, whose main points were the takeover of key executive departments of the abkhaz “state” by their russian homologues, with, at best, nominal abkhazian security institutions serving as a fig leaf. russia presented south ossetia with a draft comprising identical terms at about the same time, though the first public announcement came in november. in the treaties that were eventually signed, the abkhaz won face-saving concessions from the russians;', ' it took four drafts before the south ossetians signed, but their version was closer to the russian original.', ' (the close informal relations between south ossetia and north ossetia made the words on paper less important.) the stifling embrace of moscow—and the suspected poisoning of khajimba’s electoral rival', '—led to the ouster of khajimba in early 2020 and his replacement by aslan bzhania, himself a veteran of the kgb.', ' in south ossetia, anatoliy bibilov, who had floated between the north and south ossetian militaries, defeated tibilov.', 'russian actions have continued to ensure that georgian resentment over the ', ' remains an open wound. the process of borderization continues in south ossetia: russian border troops periodically erect new border fences that enclose bits of land hitherto under georgian control. in july 2015, new border fences cut off part of the strategic baku-supsa oil pipeline, the line that carried azerbaijani “early oil” to market in the west before the main baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline was completed. russia has not interfered with the oil flow, but the implied threat is clear.', 'for its part, it appears that georgia under saakashvili tried to return this threat by reopening links with chechen and islamist rebel groups in the north caucasus, as shevardnadze had done with the chechen commander gelayev in 2001. russia charged in 2009—and again in 2012 after a murky incident in the lopota gorge (between the pankisi gorge and dagestan)—that georgia was arming and training chechen militants to fight inside russia. in 2017, several years after saakashvili was replaced by the less anti-russian georgian dream party, the chechen commander involved in the lopota incident was killed by georgian security forces in tbilisi.', 'thus, a cycle of perceived provocations followed by emotional reactions and retaliations continues today. most recently, a russian’s mere choice of seating at a meeting led to crisis between the two countries. from june 19 to 23, 2019, the interparliamentary assembly on orthodoxy met in the parliament in tbilisi with orthodox parliamentarians from many countries in attendance. this was presumably intended as a gesture at reconciliation between the orthodox majorities of russia and georgia. on june 20, a member of the russian state duma presided over the session and sat in the georgian parliament chair’s seat. violent street protests immediately broke out in tbilisi, disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation of georgia’s parliament chair the following day.', ' amid continuing protests against russia in tbilisi, putin ordered the cessation of direct flights between georgia and russia—as he had in the run-up to the 2008 war.', ' the incident highlights that symbols of power relations evoke both charged emotions and material retaliations and that the pattern of events will be repeated for the foreseeable future.', 'it is hard not to conclude that putin’s personal overreach in ukraine has led to suboptimal results for russia in the south caucasus. when he resumed the presidency of russia, putin increased engagement with the south caucasus, perhaps hoping to gather some castaway stones closer into the russian camp. by autumn, 2013, everything seemed to be going his way: armenia (and ukraine) had bowed to his demands to reject association agreements with the eu and to sign on instead with the eaeu that putin had singlehandedly created, promoted, and dominated. relations with azerbaijan were on an even keel without much expenditure of effort. and georgia’s despised saakashvili had been replaced by a russian billionaire whose government was floating trial balloons about normalizing relations with moscow despite russia’s recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia.', 'but relations with all three south caucasus countries reverted to type after russia’s intervention in ukraine. moscow’s stifling embrace of rulers such as sargsyan and khajimba led to popular discontent and their forcible ousters. the precedents set on ukrainian territory led azerbaijan to proceed with extreme caution in its relations with russia. and russia’s expansionist policies with regard to abkhazia and south ossetia have guaranteed the hostility of the georgian populace and repudiation by what might have been a friendlier government. as observers have noted, major outside powers such as china, turkey, and the eu have capitalized on local suspicions of russia. they have developed strong interests in all three south caucasus countries and have the wherewithal to defend those interests against russian maneuvering, while also providing the locals with greater room for maneuver. turkey’s willingness to take a major military role in support of azerbaijan in the fighting that began september 27 shows that russian power no longer has the deterrent effect it once did against intervention by outside powers. russian interests themselves are not yet seriously threatened, but expansion of those interests has been blunted. one can say, then, that russia’s policies in the south caucasus and in the wider post-soviet space have forced it back on the stony path it had been treading for a generation and will probably tread for some time to come.', 'philip remler is a nonresident scholar at the carnegie endowment for international peace. prior to joining carnegie, he

of conversation at fancy restaurants and in the corridors of power.', 'the prevailing view is that a victory for biden would be bad for russia, because a democratic administration is expected to impose new economic sanctions on moscow as punishment for its bad behavior—first and foremost, for its interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election. this view is widely shared by pro-kremlin pundits, senior officials and the executives of state-owned enterprises, and is even promoted by the few remaining independent russian media outlets such as the ', ' newsletter, a daily staple in the

of being a russian asset—and who knows how to organize a normal process for national security discussions—will be able to restore some guardrails to the u.s.-russia relationship and prevent further deterioration, those people argue. a president biden would not be able to pay close attention to russia, since he and his senior advisers will be overwhelmed by domestic issues and otherwise focusing on china. but a possible new democratic administration appears to be open to retaining some pillars of the arms control regime and discussing rules of competition in cyberspace. and it could be more clear-eyed—and therefore skeptical—about the side effects and efficiency of sanctions as the united states’ major tool in russia policy. much will depend on who is put in senior positions such as

russia believes that four more years of trump could be good for moscow. if trump is reelected, the only silver lining will be the even deeper level of disarray in the western alliance and u.s.

'at the very least, analysts expect that a victory for biden would increase tensions between washington and moscow, and would raise the probability of new sanctions on russia.', 'the country is already operating under international sanctions on some key sectors and russian officials close to putin, for actions including its annexation of crimea from ukraine in 2014, interference in the u.s. election in 2016 and reported involvement in a nerve agent attack in the u.k. in 2018.', 'andrius tursa, central and eastern europe advisor at teneo intelligence, said a win for biden would improve transatlantic ties between the u.s. and europe and would see \"a renewed u.s. commitment to nato\" that would be welcomed by europe.', 'however he also said such a result would mean \"mostly downsides for russia,\" citing a recent history of mutual distrust and acrimonious relations between the kremlin and u.s. democrats.', '\"in general, a potential biden presidency would be negative for moscow and likely lead to a further deterioration of bilateral relations, both in terms of rhetoric and substance. the democratic party\\'s candidate has long maintained a tough stance towards president

russia in response to the 2014 ukrainian crisis.\"', 'a meaningful conflict resolution over crimea, and in the donbass region in east ukraine (where there are two pro-russian regions that declared themselves republics) still eludes moscow and kiev, despite efforts by germany and france to broker a lasting settlement that both sides can live with.', 'tursa argued that without tangible process in

enforcement of existing measures.', 'the risk of new sanctions could also increase, he said, ', 'any new sanctions on russia are unlikely to be imposed immediately, however, according to timothy ash,

\"important for the u.s. to have a business-like relationship with russia to ensure delivery on the u.s.\\'s strategic interests.\"', 'he said the two sides, under a biden presidency, would have to \"learn where they can tolerate each other and get along on certain areas of mutual interest — such as arms control — and reducing risks of conflict where strategic interests compete, for example on areas like ukraine, even belarus and turkey. sanctions will be part of the tool kit herein, but only one such tool.\"', ' is an area that both russia-watchers believe could be a point of mutual interest and some harmony, however. biden has signaled as much, saying in 2019 that he would want to see an extension of the major u.s.-russian nuclear arms reduction treaty, known as the new strategic arms reduction treaty, or the implementation something similar.', '\"based on recent statements from both sides, negotiations on a new strategic arms reduction treaty (start) is one area

in russia—are quite similar to those it pursues with domestic firms. authorities want to maximize surveillance potential, disrupt any possibility of domestic political unrest as a result of those companies’ content or services, and continue projecting disinformation through the internet.', 'recent battles over data localization, or the mandated storage of certain kinds of data within russia’s borders, exemplify the kremlin’s desire to maximize its own surveillance potential through foreign companies. like many authoritarian governments that viewed the internet’s free information flows as a threat to regime security, moscow ', ' in 2014 that companies with data on russian citizens store it locally. firms could maintain copies of the data elsewhere, but the data itself had to sit in russian servers, well within the broad legal and political jurisdiction of the russian security services described above. in recent years, u.s. companies like facebook and twitter have seemingly just ', ' these orders and continued paying the trivial, court-ordered ', ', but pressures are likely to grow as putin further ', '.', 'russia’s moves to cement state control over data storage fit into a broader picture of government efforts to centralize internet data flows, designed at the internet’s inception to prioritize fast and reliable delivery above all else, to enable more effective government management and surveillance. though the process is often purely technical, the objectives are fundamentally political. in practice, these measures allow the russian government to surveil dissidents, ensure the privacy of russian citizen data against perceived malicious foreign access, and extend state information control in the digital domain.', 'simultaneously justifying two of the kremlin’s other main goals in this sphere—disrupting the potential for political pluralism enabled by foreign tech platforms and projecting the state’s own disinformation through those same vectors—requires a kind of argumentative gymnastics. the russian government has for years required foreign internet companies operating in russia to remove content it deems “false.”', 'should companies not comply, the kremlin has vested powers in roskomnadzor to initiate technical blocks on those websites. although these blocks are often evaded or poorly implemented, the government has still managed to pressure foreign companies to ', ' related to the covid-19 crisis. this minimizes the presence of state-critical or -contradictory information online in russia. at the same time, russian government propaganda outlets often have a large presence in major western platforms like twitter and youtube, and officials ', ' anytime those firms take action against russian state-controlled news outlets.', 'these inherent contradictions in the russian government’s approach to international tech companies—the kremlin wants these companies to operate in russia but only on the kremlin’s own terms; it pressures companies to suppress free speech inside russia but howls when russian government messaging abroad is met with wariness—mean that there is still space for international companies to effect a certain extent of internet freedom for russian citizens. this operating space, however, is under constant threat from the russian government and is likely to be the site of several major conflicts in coming years.', 'first, international firms may continue to push back against certain elements of russian state internet control. u.s. firms that have mostly resisted complying with data localization rules have not indicated any changed willingness to follow kremlin pressure. though, resistance of this kind won’t apply to every area online; it’s important to not group different components of internet control here. content takedowns, for example, are one domain of internet control in the covid-19 pandemic where the russian government was quite successful in getting even u.s. social media companies to ', ' from their platforms, within russia, that officials deemed “false.”', 'second, the struggle to maintain a “free internet” in russia will increasingly be defined by technical dimensions. the russian government in june decided to ', ' on telegram, the encrypted messaging app, essentially ', ' it lacked the technical capacity to block it. (ironically, this comprises a certain kind of payback for none other than pavel durov—telegram’s creator—who since losing vk and fleeing russia has built his messaging app into one of the world’s most popular.)', ' the sovereign internet law that came into force in 2019 ', ' for developing pernicious new technical censorship capabilities, including—perhaps most ominously—the ability to selectively censor content on international social media platforms in russia while maintaining plausible deniability. it also required domestic internet companies to centralize their architecture so authorities could potentially cut off the russian internet from the rest of the world in the event of a security incident, broadly defined. thus, it will be incumbent on supporters of internet freedom to continue developing anti-censorship technology and maintain the kind of technical edge that has allowed telegram to continue operating in russia without compromising on surveillance or censorship. (full disclosure: one of the authors of this article works for a company that develops anti-censorship software.)', 'and with moscow advancing internet control domestically, officials will continue seeking the normalization of this practice on the global stage. recently, these efforts have focused on the united nations, where ', ' the russian state has proposed alternative cybercrime treaties that seek to justify its repressive internet policies and practices, clashing with free and open internet norms upheld by democracies worldwide. in december 2019, for the first time, one of these proposals ', ', an indicator of broader support among governments for tighter internet control. this was not an accidental occurrence. instead, it spotlights ', ' to spread their authoritarian worldview and undermine a global free and open internet model amid much democratic uncertainty on the future of the internet.', 'these outcomes should also serve as a reminder to tech companies, policymakers, and anyone who cares about maintaining an open global internet that internet freedom is neither inevitable nor permanent. russia’s domestic internet sector, once a model of pluralism and independent thought, has been thoroughly subverted to the ends of the government. as a once global internet splinters into ', ', it will take a concerted opposition effort to maintain international

are already installed.', 'the united aircraft corporation, which now has manufacturing responsibility for the blackjack, announced that the “deeply modernized” tu-160m had performed its first flight with its new serial-production nk-32-02 engines at the kazan aircraft production association airfield in southwest russia on november 3, 2020. the flight lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes and saw the

“was equipped with new flight and navigation equipment, an onboard communications system, modernized control system, radar, and ', '.”', 'lack of engines had been a serious hurdle in moscow’s ambitious plans to restart production of the blackjack, which had originally come to a halt in 1994 after just 36 examples - three of them non-flying static test airframes - had been completed. with the collapse of the soviet union, 10 of the tu-160s left in ukrainian territory were scrapped. another four of the bombers were left unfinished on the assembly line and two of these were eventually

southwestern city of samara received a contract to restart production of the blackjack’s nk-32 turbofans, now producing an improved nk-32-02 version. the first of these engines was planned to be ready for tests in 2016 and some observers have expected that the same powerplant to be used in russia’s still-secretive and still-unseen pak da new-generation bomber. as well as powering new-build

over 55,000 pounds of thrust at full afterburner.\\xa0', 'while the nk-32-02 is considered a “new” engine, it actually dates back to the mid-1980s, when the soviet union canceled its production on cost grounds. the improvements over the initial design included new blades for the compressor and turbine, plus more efficient cooling.', 'the nk-32-02 is understood to have the same output as the original powerplant but offers increased efficiency, extending the bomber’s range by around 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, according to russian media reports. tupolev has in the past claimed a 13 percent overall range increase. \\xa0', 'the program to get the blackjack back into production has been a protracted one, perhaps not altogether surprisingly, as the effort to reinstate a production line and setup required tooling after decades of inactivity is considerable. in january 2018, the russian ministry of defense signed a contract for the next 10 new-build blackjacks, which cost around $270 million per copy. plans called for a first example for the russian aerospace forces to be rolled out in 2021; according to ', ', this schedule is still on track.', 'in the past, the

parallel with the new-production blackjacks, russia has been busy with a mid-life upgrade program for its existing tu-160s, including new mission systems and avionics. originally, the existing bombers were to be designated tu-160m after completing their upgrade, while the new-build aircraft would be designated tu-160m2. this has now been rationalized, and both variants are now known as tu-160ms.', 'therefore, the first aircraft to be re-engined with the new nk-32-02 turbofans is not a new-build blackjack, but either an example from the earlier production batch that has been brought up to tu-160m status or a prototype for the new-build aircraft constructed using one of the two incomplete airframes from the original production run.', 'one of these two unfinished aircraft has been completed as a tu-160m, perhaps to serve as a proof-of-concept for the new-build bombers. this aircraft was ', ' and began flight trials in january 2018. it is named ', ' after the former russian air

ukraine in 1999, after the fleet had been left there following the dissolution of the soviet union.', \"the full tu-160m configuration includes a new novella radar as well as a new self-defense suite and electronic surveillance system. the flight deck is now equipped with a 'glass cockpit' and the revised avionics encompass the communication suite, flight control system, and navigation suite.\", 'alongside the “deeply modernized” tu-160m, russia has also been performing a less-extensive upgrade on its blackjack fleet, at a rate of one or two aircraft per year. this is the so-called “small modernization,” or tu-160m1, and provides a digital upgrade for the aircraft’s inertial navigation and engine control systems, as well as armament.', 'russia’s deputy prime minister yuri borisov has said the russian aerospace forces will continue to operate modernized tu-160ms (both upgraded and new-build examples) “until the 2050s or even the 2060s.”\\xa0', 'considering the blackjack can now

the other hand, the continued focus on the blackjack — including the tricky task of bringing it back into production — should be seen against the prospects for the future pak da, which stands for perspektivnyi aviatsionnyi kompleks dalney aviatsii, or future air complex of long-range aviation.\\xa0', 'the research and development program for the pak da began around 2009, ', ' the order to resume tu-160 production. that suggests that difficulties faced by the pak da program led to the new bomber program’s priority being reduced in favor of the tried and tested blackjack.', 'to this day, there has been no official concept art of the pak da, so we really have no idea what the design looks like. however, most observers expect that it will be a subsonic “flying wing” design, possibly with low-observable (stealthy) features.', 'tupolev’s concept for the pak da was apparently approved in 2013, after which the united aircraft corporation received a follow-on contract for detailed design work and other contracts to develop the aircraft’s systems. the then commander of russia’s long-range aviation branch, anatoly zhikharev, said in late 2014 that a pak da prototype would fly in 2019.', 'in 2015, however, the idea of resuming series production of the tu-160 appeared and with this, the urgency assigned to the pak da seems to have diminished. indeed, speaking in 2018, deputy prime minister borisov described that relaunching production of the blackjack was “a less risky path” than the pak da. “at the same time, we have postponed the pak da, to gain experience and restore technology”, he added. borisov’s predecessor, dmitry rogozin, had the same year said that the pak da would perform its first flight in 2023 or 2024.', 'the prospects of the pak da taking to the air in that kind of timeframe seem remote, especially as the focus is now on the tu-160’s continued upgrade and production restart, which will consume both funding and production capacity at the kazan plant. meanwhile, similar upgrade programs for the ', ' and ', ' strategic bombers further reduce the urgency of getting the pak da into service.\\xa0', 'there is also the enormous cost involved in getting a sophisticated “clean-sheet” design into production and service in meaningful numbers. moscow’s planned purchases of ', ' new-generation fighters currently stand at just 76 and other expensive weapons

azerbaijan emboldened by turkish support – might suggest that russia is facing a rival power in its neighbourhood. but for many in moscow the advantage of having the west out still outweighs the nuisance of having turkey in. moscow knows ankara and has learned to work with it. the two capitals are far from being allies: their goals in the middle east often stand in direct opposition to each other. but both realise they need each other, as they cannot achieve their aims without some acquiescence from the other. and most importantly, the turkish government is motivated by goals that in the kremlin’s eyes are rational: strengthening its power at home, enhancing its leverage abroad, and pursuing economic and security interests. it lacks any western-style rule-centric approach and instead subscribes to a worldview that moscow understands.', 'azerbaijan, too, has pursued its foreign policy without challenging russia’s philosophical standpoint or historical narratives even though at times it has been at odds with moscow. this is why russia might be more relaxed than expected, even though its armenian ally is in trouble: “russia may have reasons to help its ally armenia, but it has no reason at all to punish azerbaijan, which has been an example of model behavior among the former soviet states, as far as russia is concerned”, ', ' carnegie scholar alexander baunov. in

made great efforts in august to signal to moscow their restraint and desire not to ‘geopoliticise’ the conflict – in the hope that moscow would mirror the position, thus allowing for an ‘armenian-style’ political transition with no geopolitical contest around it.', 'all to no avail. after adopting a wait-and-see position for around two weeks after the election, moscow made up its mind and embarked on a strategy of transition – one that saves some face for lukashenka; deepens russia’s leverage in the country; brings to power a leader acceptable to moscow; keeps both the west and the osce at arm’s length; and, most importantly, demonstrates that popular revolution is not an effective way to transfer power. one can imagine scenarios under which moscow could reconsider its approach, change strategy, and even reach out to the lithuania-based opposition. but all these would stem from developments inside belarus itself – such as strikes that paralyse the country, or the regime splitting and crumbling – rather than something the west does or says.\\xa0', 'the lesson for the west is clear enough: to influence post-soviet – or any – crises, one needs to have true

country’s longest running protest. for more than a hundred consecutive days, thousands have taken to the streets waving flags, holding pickets and staging marches.', 'the protests were sparked in july by the arrest of the region’s former governor, sergei furgal. a charismatic businessman and local politician, furgal scored a surprise electoral victory over his predecessor vyacheslav shport, the kremlin’s preferred candidate, in 2018. in dramatic scenes earlier this year, he was pulled out of his car and arrested by federal officers, who had been flown in directly from moscow. he stands

initially demanded furgal’s release from the moscow jail where he is being held and for his case to be tried locally, their chants are now more often broad criticisms of both president vladimir putin

tended more toward ultranationalism than liberalism, calling for russian expansion into ukraine and belarus. in 2013, the party’s representatives in the state duma proposed a bill banning the use of

are sent to the region from moscow… but furgal was different. he helped us.” his arrest – and the appointment of mikhail degtyarev, a moscow politician, as his interim replacement – created a narrative that the kremlin was interfering in local affairs from afar.', 'russia’s expansive east, beginning at the urals and stretching through siberia to the sea of japan, has long had an uneasy balance with its western center. since the days of imperial russia, its towns and cities have been seen as a mere extension of the european nation – an asian frontier to be settled and tamed. as part of the soviet union, mass deportations eastwards and its status as a destination for gulag prisoners reinforced that notion. but now, as the protesters in khabarovsk show, russia’s far east might be forming its own identity.', 'one major point of contention is that while eastern russia holds much of the country’s natural resources – including oil, gas, and rare earth metals – the proceeds from their extraction are widely seen to line pockets in the west, rather than enriching local communities. a series of environmental catastrophes in the far east, such as a petrochemical spill that led to

minority ethnic groups, and the far east is home to more than 25 distinct cultures. unlike the rest of the country, protestant congregations far outnumber those belonging to the moscow-based orthodox church. in the 19th century, ukrainians were encouraged to settle along the southeastern limits of the far east, from the border with china to the sea of okhotsk. the scheme was so successful that,

places like khabarovsk to the kremlin. his hand-picked governors, like the candidate that furgal defeated in 2018, have been the linchpins of that plan.', 'historically, moscow has used the precarious geography of the far east against those who sought to distance themselves from its power. with china’s eastern borders beginning just across the river from khabarovsk, the threat of expansionism and the need for protection was a compelling argument against going it alone. but now china’s presence in the far east is being felt in an altogether different way. beijing is behind billions of dollars

navalny gaining seats in the central asian cities of tomsk and novosibirsk. while navalny’s blend of ethnic nationalism might have made him an unlikely figure for young russians to unite around, his prominence as a critic of the kremlin made his bloc the de facto choice for a protest vote.', 'while some in russia’s far east do occasionally speak of an independent “united states of siberia,” the idea lacks prominent supporters or any realistic prospect of success. however, the tensions behind it and the growing resistance to being directly governed from another continent will continue to define relations between russia’s center and its extremities. for those in russia’s far east, moscow might seem like a world away – with eight time zones and a five-day train journey dividing them.

'on', 'by', 'on october 3, 2000, prime minister atal bihari vajpayee and president vladimir putin cemented india-russia bilateral ties with the signing of the historical agreement, the “', '.” two decades since the signing of the agreement, bilateral relations are hailed to have chartered new levels of cooperation amid fast changing regional and global scenarios. while shouldering mutual interests and concerns, the strategic partnership has been at the cusp of litmus test, as it has endured events such as the 9/11 terrorist attack, colour revolutions, the georgian war, the economic depression in 2008, the 26/11 mumbai attack, the crimean referendum and its aftermath and the current covid-19 pandemic. it is therefore worth reflecting on the two decades of a seemingly positive bilateral engagement between india and russia. it is important to analyse how the agreement signed in 2000 has played a role in the continuum of ensuring the mutual understanding, peaceful cooperation and reliability between the two strategic partners. this is also an opportunity to critically evaluate the magnitude of our strategic relationship and the changes in the foreign policy priorities since 2000. given the current global context, the key question is how prepared are india and russia for insulating the strategic partnership amid the challenges in the post pandemic world?', 'the declaration of strategic partnership (2000) was signed at a time when the momentum in the bilateral relations between india and russia post-soviet collapse had fatigued due to several factors. but the most crucial factor of them all was the renewal of the ', '. the renewed 1993 treaty had almost written off the bilateral engagement, as russia clarified that it was no longer willing to make any defence commitment during the time of any external military threat to india – a key security clause (article ix) that constituted the very core of the 1971 indo-soviet treaty.', 'the strategic partnership treaty signed in 2000 gave a new lease of life as it restored india-russia relations to respectable levels.both the countries realised the need to develop a multifaceted bilateral cooperation in all possible spheres of defence, energy, space, nuclear, science and technology etc. india’s strategic partnership with russia since then has been unique, intense and substantive in many ways. mainly, the treaty led to the institutionalization of high level political interactions through annual bilateral summits – a key feature of the agreement to foster extensive collaboration and dynamism in the partnership. the twenty annual bilateral summits held so far between india and russia have in particular seen major agreements and initiatives undertaken to strengthen the partnership to higher levels.', 'additionally, in 2010, the bilateral ties were further elevated with the signing of the “', '.” arguably, the partnership between the two countries has been successfully reflected in many instances at regional and global platforms. ', ' general assembly referendum against russia for its accession of crimea in 2014 and russia’s unequivocal support to india on the kashmir issue are few cases in point.', 'regarding strategic partnership in sensitive spheres of cooperation between india and russia, defence cooperation continues to be one of the major boosters for engagement between the two countries. india has acknowledged russia’s contribution in assisting the former in military power projection and preserving its national security interests. although in recent times there is downgrading in the purchase of russian defence equipment by india, the cooperation in this sphere has been unassailable given that it has progressed from buyer-seller relations to joint research development and production, high-end technology transfer that has encouraged india’s quest for indigenous defence capabilities. from the induction of ins vikramaditya to the joint production of brahmos missile, india-russia defence cooperation has achieved new capacities through acquisitions and joint development. in fact, russia’s resurgence as a military power in recent times is conducive to india’s domestic initiatives such as the make in india project. the finalising of the ', ' despite the threat of imposition of caatsa sanctions has shown india’s predictable resistance to external pressures given its historical ties with russia.', 'indo-russian nuclear cooperation constitutes an important element of our strategic partnership. the kudankulam nuclear power plant (knpp) has become one of the biggest success stories of india-russia cooperation. as unit 1 and unit 2 start commercial operation, the process for reactor buildings of units 3 and 4 have already begun. with the construction of 12 nuclear power plants planned, india-russia nuclear cooperation has indeed reached new heights. india, russia and bangladesh signed a trilateral agreement in march 2018, for the construction of a npp in rooppur, bangladesh.', ' has been another major element of the strategic partnership, since russia, an export-oriented energy country, will aim to leverage its energy card with india, an import-oriented energy market. india’s interests in the arctic, for instance, especially energy resources, are a crucial aspect for india’s growing energy security needs. ', '. this is seen as a great step towards strengthening india-russia energy cooperation.', 'the bilateral partnership, which has a global strategic connotation, has seen both the countries enthusiastically promote the idea of building a multipolar world order and changing the global financial structure. in this regard, both india and russia have envisaged promoting a harmonious global order based on international law and collective decision-making that includes developing countries and is not monopolised by developed countries alone. india and russia, along with other players such as china, have succeeded in establishing non-western organisations such as brics and sco. the member states have, within their capabilities and limitations, established mechanisms that address economic and strategic interests, such as the new development bank. while brics and sco have become tools of political signalling on issues related to global affairs, there however exist asymmetries among the member states with regard to economic growth performance, distribution of resources and military strength. additionally, although china is a member of such multilateral organisations, at the individual level beijing has exercised assertive posturing that has caused concern in india. this can be seen by its irrational border claims and actions in the indian ocean region. the role of russia especially during the time of crisis between india and china is therefore anticipated to be non-partisan and meaningful.', 'when the treaty of strategic partnership was signed in 2000, the world was at the brink of a war on terrorism after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade centre. both india and russia, at their respective level, joined the bandwagon on the global war on terror. both parties, as bilateral partners which have been victims of terrorist attacks, voiced their interests and concerns in combating terrorism and related activities. india and russia have therefore cooperated at bilateral and multilateral levels. for instance, ', '. india and russia also share the mutual interest of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their possible acquisition by terrorist groups.', 'while both india and russia assert their distinctive identity in world politics respectively, the strategic partnership has seen close coordination of foreign policy interests to a wide range of international and regional issues. both countries firmly believe that intensification of the indo-russian strategic partnership can help respond to the challenges thrown up by global changes in a more effective way. while both india and russia have a diverging approach on the indo-pacific narrative, one cannot deny that the two countries understand the need for ', ' in accordance with the universally accepted principles of international law. this includes combating piracy at sea and providing humanitarian aid during natural disasters. the two countries have shown keen interest in restoring peace and stability in afghanistan. eurasian integration has been a key priority in the india-russia strategic partnership. russia understands that in its quest for “greater eurasia,” india is a vital player for its huge market potential, economic growth performance, military strength and enhanced position in international affairs.', 'strategic partnership in ', ' between india and russia since the soviet era and has continued to remain one even today. in fact, both countries have agreed to expand their relations in the aerospace sphere, an area of traditional cooperation for decades. more than 500 joint projects involving scientists and research institutes from both countries have been undertaken within the framework of various initiatives since 2000.', 'while critically evaluating the two decades of strategic partnership between india and russia, it is tempting to compare india’s strategic partnership with other major global players and the strategic partnership that it shares with russia. the new realities of the dynamic nature of international relations have definitely posed a challenge to the partnership. the pursuing of an all-alignment foreign policy has caused a certain level of discomfort in the bilateral relations. india’s growing proximity with the u.s. and russia’s compromised defence cooperation with china and mending of ties with pakistan in recent times has caused anxiety in the strategic partnership between india and russia. one possible inference that one can draw is the constant comparison to the current india-russia partnership with that of the nostalgia of indo-soviet ties. but one needs to bear in mind that compared to the strategic partnership that both india and russia share with other major players, there are limitations and shrouded with lack of trust. india’s defence relations with u.s., for instance, is yet to make any substantive development in joint production and restrictiveness about its technology compared to russia’s generosity to sharing defence technology and russia’s relations with pakistan is eclipsed with lack of trust and understanding. as for russia-china relations, there is growing speculation of a possible role reversal in the partnership given china’s growth in global politics in recent times.', 'however, there are few stumbling blocks in india-russia defence cooperation, especially the shifting trends in partnership, for example defence engagement between russia and china. russia’s current cooperation with china has emerged exclusively, as it includes cooperation in sensitive fields, such as strategic missile defence, hypersonic technology, and the construction of nuclear submarines. with ', ', allowing for the latter to be well equipped with similar and more advanced capabilities, china is a major security concern for india. hence, given the way ', ', collaboration in advanced future weapon systems, including quantum technology and artificial intelligence, should be enhanced further between india and russia.', 'indo-russian relations are undoubtedly at the cusp of a litmus test. nonetheless, the strategic partnership should see the future of asia beyond the u.s. and china factors, and both india and russia can play a decisive role in promoting their mutual interests in the region.', 'the rapid and uncontrollable spread of covid-19 in the past seven months has impacted the global order and the interconnected systems. reflecting the spirit of the partnership in times of crisis, ', '. russia also welcomed india’s goodwill gesture to send medical supplies to help fight the virus.', 'critics have often pointed out that the strategic partnership is yet to achieve its full potential, given the fact that some of the spheres of cooperation continue to be remain obsolete, for instance, the economic relations. additionally, given nearly 70 years of diplomatic relations, soft power capabilities, cultural diplomacy, academic exchange programmes, and labour migration are at an imperceptible status.', 'trade and investment remains the weakest link in our strategic partnership and falls far short of our potential, which unfortunately is not commensurate with our high-level political cooperation. post the announcement of the strategic agreement in 2000, which largely promotes the strengthening of economic relations between india and russia, the trade cart received much required upgrade. potential areas of trade have been explored, which include trade and investment, energy, nuclear, science and technology, pharmaceuticals, it, steel, diamonds, fertilizers, infrastructure, heavy engineering and food products. exploring economic prosperity, sustainable development, and free movement of people, information, knowledge, ideas and greater institutional links has also become crucial.', 'in fact, both countries have set a target of ', ' in each other’s country by the year 2025. it is also heartening that new options are being explored to further expand the domain of economic cooperation, eurasian integrity, regional cooperation, free trade agreements, connectivity and trade corridors have gained the utmost importance in the annual bilateral summits in the past two decades. the two countries have also set up mechanisms such as intergovernmental commissions. for example, ', ' (irigc-tec), the international north south transport corridor and the eurasian economic union, which have emerged as immediate priority areas for strong economic cooperation between the two countries.', 'the russian far-east is another region for potential economic engagement. india’s presence in the eastern economic forum (eef) is aimed at developing trade, commerce, investment, railway infrastructure, steel plants, defence, space, ports and shipping. india has successfully participated in the annual eef, with prime minister ', ' for the development of the far east. other than these developments, our economic ties are focused on exploring the potential of sub-regional cooperation. sub-regional cooperation has emerged as one of the prospective areas of cooperation and regional connectivity to add further impetus to the economic cooperation between india and russia. the key goal is to cement and institutionalise cooperation between the states and union territories of the republic of india and provinces of the russian federation.', 'to further bolster india’s far ambitions, an ', ' of four indian states led by the commerce and industry minister of india piyush goyal visited vladivostok to explore the opportunities and potential of business to business (b2b) cooperation in the far. with the introduction of the ', ' in the world, the need for both india and russia to tap the potentials of agricultural sector is crucial. regional connectivity needs due attention, hence the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors, such as chennai-vladivostok, needs prompt engagement.', 'the major impact of the pandemic has prompted countries to explore alternate market destinations and shifts in the business environment. the crisis has opened opportunities for countries such as india and russia to reposition themselves in the global supply chain. russia, with its efforts to attract investment to the far east, and india, with its huge manpower and existing available manufacturing units, should be endorsed as potential and suitable alternatives for manufacturing, instead of developed nations.', 'despite the seemingly successful bilateral relations between india and russia, the strategic community is incomplete if there is shortfall in establishing strong people-to-people engagement. since the soviet collapse, bilateral relations have seen minimal cultural diplomacy, academic exchange and labour migration. perhaps new vistas of cooperation could be explored to promote soft power capabilities between the two countries, such as cinema, which has always been one of the most successful foreign policy tools to enhance cultural exchange and people-to-people contact between countries.', 'the film industry is a great medium for spreading narratives, and in india movies have an immense following as well as impact on the minds of the population. india and russia collaborated in movie production during the soviet era, however, the trend did not last long due to the fall of the soviet union, among other factors. the time is right for both india and russia to collaborate in the entertainment industry, especially through joint production of movies and creating powerful narratives related to bilateral cooperation. india and russia must concentrate more on the content of the movie rather than joint production alone, as for the audience the content matters more than the producer. moreover, it can have an everlasting impact on the minds of the indian population if the content projects a russian character aiding/collaborating with an indian protagonist in a movie in bringing down an antagonist. also, the indian movie industry is always on the look for exotic locations in foreign lands. hence, in order to attract the indian movie industry, russia could look into easing travel and other shooting permissions within its jurisdictions. such an effort would not only bring closer industry ties, but also be able to showcase the russia and its rich culture to the indian population, thereby acting as a window of promotion for russian tourism.', 'regarding geopolitical realignment, today the global community is seeking pragmatic internationalism. the role of india and russia is crucial in their efforts to diffuse the multipolar world system. this is also relevant for regional alliances to actively engage politically and economically, which should help bilateral relations between the two countries elevate to a higher pedestal in post-pandemic world order.', 'the current global situation has given rise to some daunting challenges for the partnership once again. some of the ', ' are linked to the disruptions being caused to the international order by traditional and non-traditional threats such as climate change, ', ', secure communication challenges etc. nurturing hopes for stability and prosperity in eurasia in the post pandemic world, bilateral relations between india and russia and their proactive role in regional mechanisms such as sco, eurasian economic union (eaeu), and russia-india-china (ric) are viewed as an integral part of this construct. regional connectivity needs due attention including the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors.', 'in conclusion, the signing of the milestone agreement in 2000 was the outcome of developments that took place in bilateral relations between india and russia after the fall of the soviet union. the main aim of the agreement was to elevate the partnership to new level of cooperation and put speculations and uncertainties in the relationship to rest. over the past twenty years of relations, the partnership has seen many ups and downs. nonetheless, this has not allowed any major damage that could impact or lead to any serious conflict of interest between the two countries. having said that, the coveted relations built over the years cannot be taken for granted. in this regard, apart from political elites and bureaucrats playing a crucial role in enhancing the relations, academicians, artists, students, the research community, think tanks and educational institutions should contribute to forming the true essence of the partnership. the youth, in particular, need to draw inspiration from each other’s rich history and cultural relevance, carrying forward the vision for a long-term partnership. the engagement of both countries in the international ecosystem in the post pandemic world has become even more relevant, as it has given rise to new challenges and opportunities. the strategic partnership between india and russia nevertheless needs to insulate the mutual interests from challenges that emerge from within and from external factors. perhaps, the need for a reality check and serious introspection will be crucial as the challenges are only set to grow given the dynamism of international relations.', 'from our partner ',

with you.\\xa0\", 'michael morrell: let me start with a couple of points for our listeners. first, i want to congratulate you on your new book, ', \" i've read it. it's terrific. i think it's a must read for anyone interested in national security. and i actually see it as a reference book for understanding the key issues. and i see myself pulling it down off the shelf from time to time. when i'm thinking about something, i want to have to talk about something, when i'm writing something. i think it's a very important contribution to the literature on the threats and challenges we face as a nation. so thank you. thank you very much for writing it.\", 'gen. mcmaster: well, michael, thanks so much. i mean it, somebody with your background, experience and knowledge to to endorse it like that. that means a lot to me that you judge it to have been worthwhile. thank you.', \"michael morrell: second, having you with us to talk about your book is a perfect way for us to kick off what is for us,\\xa0 going to be a new series on the key national security issues facing the united states. the series, which we're going to work very hard to be nonpartisan, will run between the \", \" and the inauguration. and finally, i should mention to my listeners that this episode is going to run the day after the election, but that you and i are taping it the friday before the election. so you and i have no idea what's going to happen on election day. so people should just know that as they're as they're listening to our conversation. and i think that's actually a good thing for our conversation, because what i want to do at the end of the day is get your sense of what is going to face the president who is sworn in on january 20th, no matter who that person happens to be.\", \"michael morrell: h.r. before we get to the individual issues that i want to walk through with you, i'd love to ask you why you decided to write the book that you did. you obviously could have written a very different kind of book. and i'm sure that there were publishers who were encouraging you to do that. but you chose not to do that. you chose to write a very serious look at the threats and challenges that face us as a nation. why did you take the route that you did?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, michael, thank you. i served in the army for thirty four years. so as i transitioned to what is my only second career in my adult life, i made out probably quite predictably, a mission statement for myself. and that was in my second career to try to deepen our understanding of the most crucial challenges we face as a way to better inform the american people about foreign policy and national security issues, and with the hope that if we learn more about these challenges that we face, we can demand better. demand a better foreign policy from our elected leaders. but then also, i hope that the book and the work that i'm doing around the book will help bring americans back together. right. because i don't think any of these issues should be partisan in nature. what i'm hoping for is that a deeper understanding of these challenges we face. and i think what should be our common commitment to try to build a better future for generations to come will help bring our country back together, at least around foreign policy and national security issues.\", 'michael morrell: h.r., what are the main themes of the book? what do you want readers to walk away remembering?', \"gen. mcmaster: well, what are the themes that runs through the book is this idea of strategic narcissism. i think this is one of the reasons why our competence, our ability to compete, at least in the post-cold war period, has been significantly diminished. and by strategic narcissism, i mean, our tendency to define the world only in relation to us and then to assume that what we decide to do or decide not to do is decisive to achieving a favorable outcome. and of course, you know, michael, with your long experience with intelligence, this is flawed because it's self-referential and it doesn't acknowledge, you know, the degree to which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future. so the book is then an argument, an argument for cultivating with my friend and great historian zachary shore has termed strategic empathy. and this is an effort, an effort to understand better what drives and constrains the other. especially adversaries, rivals and enemies and what drives and constrains the other often times is ideology and emotion and aspirations. so the theme in the book that also is important is an effort to understand how the recent past produced the present as the first step in making a projection into the future. so the book is an argument for the understanding of history and appreciation for the complex causality of events and a focus on understanding these crucial challenges we're facing from the perspective from the perspective of others.\", \"michael morrell: you know, that's one of the that's one of the main jobs of the intelligence community. right? is to is to give our decision makers the point of view of the other guy. the guy sitting across the table from you, the guy sitting across the battlefield from you. but what's the other guy thinking? what are his constraints? what are his interests? and that's extraordinarily important. right?\", \"gen. mcmaster:\\xa0 of course, it's not a new idea. it goes back to sun tzu, but i think it's we started to neglect the importance of this, especially in the post-cold war period, a period that i describe as a period of over optimism. over optimism that led to complacency and a bit of hubris. and this over optimism was in large measure a set up, i think a set of for significant disappointments in the two thousands disappointments, of course, associated with the mass murder attacks of september 11th, 2001, but also the unanticipated length and difficulty of wars in afghanistan and in iraq and, of course, followed by a financial crisis. and so i think it was in the two thousands that this emotional impetus behind our foreign policy shifted from overoptimism to pessimism and from maybe a tendency to under appreciate the risks and costs of action, to a tendency to underappreciate the risks and costs of inaction. and i think that strategic narcissism is the cause, really, in both cases.\", 'michael morrell: you know, the other thing that strikes me when you talk about the importance of history is i always thought sitting in deputies meetings that it would have been incredibly valuable to actually take a few minutes and every deputies meetings or principals meetings to talk about the history of the issue, just to review how you got from point a to point b, and we never did that in multiple administrations in which i served, but i always thought that that would have been really valuable.', \"gen. mcmaster: \\xa0well, michael, you're absolutely right about that. i'll tell you, one of the one of the great gifts i had, i think before earlier my career was the opportunity to read things, study and write history. and the first book i wrote was \", ', which is a story about how and why vietnam became an american war.\\xa0', \"and one of the lessons i learned from the study of that history was that it was important to understand problems and challenges holistically before leaping into action. when i came in as national security adviser, i did my best to at least avoid making the same mistakes and we put in place a principle small group framing session. i know that's a mouthful, but as we developed these strategies for the most crucial challenges we were facing, we began with this framing session that was organized around a five page paper that included only really the description of the challenge. how we got to where we are, a bit of the history of it, and then an inventory of our vital interests that were at stake, view of that challenge through the lens of those vital interests and draft overarching goals and more specific objectives, followed by assumptions.\\xa0\", \"assumptions about the degree to which we and like-minded partners have agency or influence over this challenge. then an inventory of obstacles to progress and opportunities that we could exploit. and that's it. then we had a discussion about the nature of the challenge. first, the policy coordinating committee, which, you know, are the real workers who are going to work on this project. they're listening in. so they're getting, they're hearing at the cabinet level, a discussion about the nature of the problem and then a refinement of it. once that part of the meeting was done, then we shifted to a discussion of what are your ideas? how do we integrate the elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to overcome these obstacles and exploit these opportunities? then they got to hear the treasury secretary say what we have. we have economic and financial tools available. but those ought to be combined with diplomacy and maybe law enforcement efforts. and then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with. so i think that, i hope that's a process that will be sustained. i don't think my successor hung onto it. it will have to be resurrected at some point if it is deemed as useful by a future national security adviser.\", \"michael morrell: i'm michael morrell today, we have with us h.r. mcmaster, a senior fellow at both stanford university's hoover institution and its graduate school of business. a career u.s. army officer and national security adviser to president trump. ok, so what i'd love to do is go through the individual issues. and what i'd like to do is just throw one out, get you to frame it. what's the threat or challenge that we face? what's the history? how did we get here? what's our interest that's at stake? and how do you think we as a nation need to go about dealing with it? let's start with the big one. let's start with the big enchilada, china.\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think china is a great example of strategic narcissism at work, and especially this assumption that we clung to for too long, that china, having been welcomed into the international order, would play by the rules, would liberalize its economy, and as it prospered, it would liberalize its form of government. of course, that's not true. that's not true because we undervalue the degree to which emotions and ideology drive and constrain the chinese communist party. and what i would argue in battlegrounds is that the party is driven mainly by fear, fear of losing its exclusive grip on power and an associated ambition. the ambition to achieve national rejuvenation for china to take center stage in the world again after the tragedy, as they portrayed as the century of humiliation. it is that combination of fear and aspiration that is driving the party's effort to extend and tighten its exclusive grip on power internally.\", \"this is why there are over a million people in concentration camps in xinjiang and there's a campaign of cultural genocide ongoing.\\xa0\", \"this is why the party is extending their repressive arm to hong kong and perfecting their technologically enabled orwellian surveillance police state. this is what we're seeing and then what is even more troubling, i think, is the parties now effort to export its authoritarian mercantilist model.\\xa0\", \"through a number of strategies that aim to create servile relationships with countries and then ultimately through economic means, as well as the growth in the people's liberation army's capabilities to establish areas of privacy across the new pacific region that exclude the united states and then it challenged the united states in the free world globally. if china succeeds, i mean, our world will be less free, less prosperous and less safe. so the stakes are high and it's past time for us to recognize the need to compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form of aggression that the parties engaged in.\", 'michael morrell: what would an effective china strategy look like to you?', \"gen. mcmaster: well, i think the trump administration, if it gets credit for anything, should get credit for a fundamental shift in our policy toward china. one that was long overdue and one that i think is fundamentally sound and this is the idea that we have to compete. and it was under the strategy of of cooperation and engagement that the chinese communist party was emboldened. competition doesn't need to lead to confrontation. in fact, quite the opposite. and i think we have returned to arenas of competition involving countering more effectively china's campaign of sustained industrial espionage against us, countering a range of china's unfair trade and economic practices, doing so in large measure through effective international cooperation, for example, establishing better standards for infrastructure investment internationally, the law enforcement actions and investigations that have gone on against apt10.\\xa0\", \"the main hacking arm of the chinese communist party, i think have been very effective as well, combined with sanctions and other actions against the aggressive arms of the party. but really, i think the most important thing for us to do, and i argue this in a chapter battlegrounds entitled turning weakness into strength is to take what the chinese communist party sees as sources of weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strengths. what does the party fear? the party fears that the people, the chinese people, might want to have a say in how they're governed so we should strengthen our democratic processes. the party fears rule of law. we should strengthen rule of law in the united states and with countries that are working to strengthen rule of law in their countries, the party fears freedom of press, freedom of the expression. we need to strengthen our authoritative sources of information and recognize that investigative journalism is a great counter to some of these pernicious strategies that the parties are pursuing. so i think that part of it is defensive, but part of it is more introspective and trying to maintain our competitive advantages.\", \"michael morrell: this is intelligence matters. i'm michael morrell. we're talking with former national security adviser h.r. mcmaster. so russia, how do you think about russia?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, russia is a significant threat to us because putin again, is examining the assumptions of previous policies. putin is not going to become like the grinch on christmas eve. right, his heart is not going to get too big as the size gets bigger and he's not going to decide, ok, well maybe the future of russia does lie more with the west and treat the united states and europe and others differently. putin is driven by a sense of honor lost after the breakup of the soviet union. he is also driven by this associated desire to restore russia to national greatness. he's also cognizant, though, of the fact that he cannot compete with this on our own terms. and so what his theory of victory is, is to drag us all down and then to be the last man standing and the means that he's using to do this. i describe the chinese approach of cooption, coercion and concealment. and i use alliteration in the russian chapters as well.\\xa0\", 'it is a campaign of disruption, disinformation and denial to try to disrupt us, to disrupt our effective governance, to disrupt us economically and to use economic coercion when he can, such as he has done in europe effectively from time to time and with energy dependence. then to deny even his most egregious acts, especially the sustained campaign of cyber enabled information warfare against us, which is designed to polarize us, to pit us against each other, to reduce our confidence in who we are as a people and in our democratic institutions and principles and processes. russia is a dangerous threat for for these reasons. and the best way to counter the first step is to pull the curtain back on this activity, to educate ourselves about it, to be less susceptible to russian information, to not be our own worst enemies, as i think both political parties in many instances have because they compromise and they compromised our principles to score some partisan political points and in doing so, make themselves vulnerable to russian disinformation and propaganda.', 'michael morrell: then what about raising the cost to him of doing this? is that an option here in terms of deterring him?', \"gen. mcmaster: absolutely. this is what i advocated for in battlegrounds is that we have to impose costs on the kremlin, on putin, that exceed those that he factors in at the beginning of his decision making process. it was my last day really in an oval office meeting, it was the day that president trump decided to impose significant costs on russia in response to the attempted\\xa0 poisoning, murder of sergei skripal and his daughter with with a banned military grade nerve agent and an act that put thousands of uk citizens at risk. and it was at that on that occasion that we expelled you over 60 undeclared intelligence agents that hits putin where it matters. because these are agents that were critical to his sustained campaign of subversion against us. and we impose significant costs, additional costs on russia through sanctions and other actions, the closing of the san francisco consulate, as you know, michael, was a major intelligence collection platform for the russians here in silicon valley and the bay area. so, that was significant and i think that sent a strong message. now, after navalny's poisoning, i'd like to see us do the same thing, you know, and as he's infiltrating more little green men now into belarus and as he continues to enable the serial episodes of mass homicide, that is the syrian civil war, to support hawthorne's way perpetuating violence in libya.\\xa0\", \"michael morrell: i'm michael morell. we're talking with h.r. mcmaster, former national security adviser to president trump and author of the just published book \", \" by the way, if you missed any of today's show, you can listen to it as a podcast. just search \", \"wherever you get your podcasts. let's talk about north korea. give us your sense on north korea?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, thanks, michael. of course, it's important for us to recognize going in right that north korea is the only communist hereditary dictatorship in the world. and it is the nature of the kim family regime that we have to take into account when we're considering the danger that the regime poses to the world if it does possess the most destructive weapons on earth. the kim family regime is driven mainly by this drive to remain in power. it is, of course, known as the hermit kingdom. it is a gulag state that fears any kind of opening to the world. and it is a regime that across now three generations of dictators has been committed to unifying the korean peninsula under the so-called red banner. and i think as we look at north korea's pursuit of the most destructive weapons on earth, we have to be at least open to the possibility that it wants those weapons to coerce the united states off the peninsula as the first step in the forcible reunification of the peninsula. and, of course, that would that would be the form of a destructive war.\", \"gen. mcmaster: it's also important, i think, for us to recognize that it is highly unlikely that north korea wants nuclear weapons just to deter us. north korea already had a very significant deterrence capability with its conventional weapons. and the fact that it's so many thousands of artillery pieces are within the range of of seoul, south korea. and then also, i think it's important to recognize that every act of aggression on the korean peninsula since the north invaded the south in june of 1950 has been initiated by the north. the other aspect of this problem, michael, that is very important to consider is that if north korea gets the weapon is recognized as a as a nuclear power, like who doesn't get one after that? right. this japan starts to have conversation with south korea. by the way, north korea never met a weapon it didn't try to sell to somebody excluding its nuclear program until the israeli defense force bombed that facility in 2007. so it's very dangerous. i think it's dangerous as well because of the ideology that drives this regime. it's a warped ideology. this is the zushi ideology which has turned deprivation into a sign of virtue and racial superiority. and the north korean people have gone through generations of brainwashing. so this is a big problem, michael. i think that the approach that is in place now, the strategy of maximum pressure, it's the best course of action. i think we have to test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince kim jong un that he is safer without the weapons than he is with them. i think it will be important for whoever is sworn in on january 20th that they recognize that we should not repeat the failed pattern of previous efforts, not allow north korea to draw us into negotiations with an act of aggression and with the demands of big payoff up front just for the privilege of talking with them. to not again, engage in long, drawn out negotiations that delivers a weak agreement that he immediately breaks again.\", \"michael morrell: you've said something here that i think is really important, because i think the conventional wisdom is that he wants these weapons for deterrence. right. that he's worried about us attacking him. but you're arguing that it's more than that. that this gets to the heart of what north korea has always wanted, which is to reunify the peninsula, which i think is a really important point here that changes how you think about how you have to deal with him?\", \"gen. mcmaster: this is an argument, michael, for strategic empathy. right? to view these complex challenges from the perspective of the other and unless you do that,\\xa0 you're susceptible to mirror imaging. and, of course, my research for the book, \", ', you know that sensitized me to this. it was in the run up to the vietnam war where some of those who were planning the vietnam strategy development, the strategy actually referred to the reasonable man theory of english common law and assumed that ho chi minh would respond as the theoretical reasonable man. would respond without taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played in driving and constraining the north vietnamese leadership.', \"michael morrell: do you think at the end of the day it's possible to convince him that he would be better off, that he would be more secure without these weapons?\", \"gen. mcmaster: i do think it's possible, and the reason i think it's possible because we've never really put maximum pressure on the north. and so we have this opportunity now thanks really to the tremendous work by ambassador nikki haley when she was at the u.n. as you know, michael, these u.n. security council sanctions on north korea are unprecedented and reach. the key now, though, is to enforce them. of course, the key country that needs to enforce them is china. and i think if china doesn't enforce them, if china continues to be complicit with illicit financial flows into and out of the country, to continue to provide energy and other materials to the north that are limited by these sanctions. then i think it's time for us to consider secondary sanctions and maybe on chinese financial institutions.\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think as we see the smuggling of coal and the transshipment of coal and oil and fuel, i think that under article two, i think the president could use article two authority to interdict those ships. as you know, michael, this is something we can't really talk about. there are other means of putting pressure on the north. i think that we haven't done it yet. i think we have to at least test the thesis because the alternatives are so bleak of either accepting north korea as a nuclear power and coping with that threat or a war. right. that would be very costly, i think it's worth pursuing.\", \"michael morrell: we still have more to discuss with general mcmaster and we'll be right back with our final segment.\\xa0\", \"michael morrell: we're back with more intelligence matters, i'm michael morrell. our guest is h.r. mcmaster, senior fellow at both stanford university's hoover institution and its graduate school of business. so, sir, let me ask you about another tough one, iran.\", 'gen. mcmaster: on iran, what i tell the story of in ', \", michael, is we have to view the problem of iran with two fundamental considerations foremost in our minds. the first is the ideology of the revolution and how that drives iranian leadership and the iranian leadership is the supreme leader and the guardian council and the islamic revolutionary guards corps. we have this fantasy i think that the reformers, the republicans, within iraq are going to prevail. they lost, the revolutionaries are in charge. the hardliners are in charge. and whenever they put this forward, the shop window of minister zarif, their foreign minister or president rouhani, that's all you're getting is the shop window. that ideology is it drives the iranian regime to continue its four decade long proxy war against the great satan, the united states, the little satan, israel, the arab monarchies and the west broadly. and so we have to consider the ideology of the regime and and this 40 year long proxy war.\", \"gen. mcmaster: what i argue for in the book is to force the iranian regime to make a choice. you can either be treated like a normal nation or you can continue to wage this proxy war, to support terrorist organizations and keep the middle east enmeshed in this perpetual state of sectarian civil war. the choice is yours, and to impose that choice, i think what we should not do is lift the arms embargo to the regime. what we should not do is lift any of the sanctions. in fact, we should impose the costs on the regime to constrain the resources they have available to continue their proxy wars against us, but then also ultimately maybe to convince the iranian people. that they ought to have a government in place and i'm not talking about like a 2003 regime change, but a government in place that shifts away from its permanent hostility to the united states, israel and the west. i think that's the only path that i see forward. i think our policies ought to aim to effect that change in the regimes permanent hostility. and until it does any agreement with them, it can't be trusted and any agreement with them that allows them to escape. making that choice like the iran nuclear deal did, i think is to our disadvantage.\", \"michael morrell: so you don't see the regime changing policy on its own. do you think that has to be forced internally by the iranian people? is that fair?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, michael, i think on iran, it's important to keep two considerations in mind in crafting a strategy toward iran. first of all, that it's the ideology of the regime that drives their hostile behavior toward us. and we have to recognize that it's the supreme leader, it's the guardian council, its islamic revolutionary guards corps, who are in charge. right. there was a struggle, you know, across the history of iran since the revolution in 1979 between the republicans and the revolutionaries. hey, the revolutionaries won. and and we have to recognize that the second consideration is that this regime has waged a four decade long proxy war against the great satan, us, the little satan, israel, the arab monarchies and the west generally. we have to craft our strategy in recognition of this regime's permanent hostility to us. of course, i think the best way to approach it in the title of the chapter in \", 'is ', \", forcing the regime to make a choice of either being a responsible nation and then being treated as such or suffering the consequences. and this is why i think it's very important to keep the arms embargo in place. i think it's very important to keep the sanctions in place on the regime to, in the short term, reduce the resources it has available to wage this proxy war and in the long term, hopefully convince the iranian people to demand a change in the nature of the government such that it ceases as permanent hostility.\", \"michael morrell: okay, islamic extremism, it's waned a bit in the threat, but it's still there. from west africa, to the middle east, to south asia, to southeast asia. how do you think about that problem long term?\\xa0\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think the reason that we haven't had another attack on the scale of the most devastating terrorist attack in history of september 11th, 2001, is our tremendous intelligence professionals, our diplomats, our military who's been engaged against this threat from jihadist terrorist organizations since 9/11. what i'm concerned about, michael, is that these groups, i think are more dangerous today than they were maybe even on september 10th, 2001. and that's because, of course, those who committed the mass murder attacks against us on 9/11 were the mujahideen alumni of the resistance to the soviet occupation of afghanistan. well, now the al-qaida alumni, the isis alumni, the lashkar-e-taiba alumni are orders of magnitude greater and they have access to more and more destructive capabilities. and the reason we've been safe is because we've been engaged and now we have this narrative of ending endless wars and disengaging. well, i think what americans need to know is that we are engaged so we can enable others to bear the brunt of this fight. i mean, this disengagement from afghanistan, i think is a tragedy. the way that we've gone about this, i think we should recognize the sacrifices of our longest war and in particular that 10 of our courageous servicemen, soldiers, gave their lives for our country, our security this year. but we have to also recognize that 30 afghan soldiers and police a day die defending the freedoms that they've enjoyed since the defeat of the taliban in 2001 a removal of the taliban from power. so i think that we need to make a sustained argument to the american people for engagement with this problem of jihadist terrorism. because if we don't, michael, we'll go back to 1998. remember when we after the embassy bombings, we fired a few cruise missiles and called it a day. right, that didn't work out.\", \"michael morrell: the last issue i want to ask you about is venezuela, which i know you care about. my understanding is that when you arrived at the white house, you were going over the issues and you kind of stumbled on venezuela and said, hey, you know what's going on there? that doesn't look like we're paying attention to this, talk about venezuela and why it's important?\", \"gen. mcmaster: well, it's immensely important because this is a humanitarian catastrophe in venezuela. it's a humanitarian catastrophe that's brought on by an authoritarian regime that is denying the venezuelan people a say in how they're governed. when we looked at the problem and the nature of the maduro regime and the chavista movement, we concluded that this was, again, a corrupt government that is using criminalized patronage networks to effect control of its people. it uses these motorcycle gangs and militias to overwhelm any kind of opposition. it ended the constitution. so we said what's should our goal be? our goal should be to work with others, to work with like-minded countries, to effect a restoration of constitutional rule in venezuela. and to do that, we felt as if we had to pursue three objectives. one of those objectives would be to try to strengthen the opposition. right. to help the opposition come together. i think you saw that with the rise of bolsonaro. you know, who was really from the people. you know, he's not a member of the caracas polo club, for example. i think he's somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged now so significantly under chávez, and now maduro.\", \"gen. mcmaster: the second objective would be for the people to be able to attribute their grievances back to the government, not to blame the yankees, you know, for example. and the third related to that would be to try to galvanize really popular support for restoration of constitutional government. i think the measures we put in place were sound. of course, they have proven inadequate. and i think we thought that economic sanctions would maybe have a significant effect. but the reason they haven't had a bigger effect is there's a huge black market, illicit economy that's run by maduro. he uses that to sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gangs of thugs who really prevent any real opposition from gaining traction. but i think i'm proud of what we did in this period of time. we worked very closely with partners, especially in the western hemisphere, mexico, under the foreign minister of the great luis videgaray, who was a wonderful partner, took a leading role in much of the work that we did. we try'd to get the organization of american states and others to do more. but it was really the community of like-minded nations brazil, colombia, peru, panama, argentina. we worked very closely together on this problem and i think remain committed to trying to effect a restoration of constitutional government in venezuela.\", \"michael morrell: you've been fantastic with your time. i just want to ask you two more questions, we have a couple of minutes left, so we'll need to be quick here.\", \"michael morrell: the first is that in order to deal with all of these problems that you've talked about, you know, we need a healthy national security toolkit. healthy diplomacy, healthy intelligence capabilities, healthy military capabilities. what's your assessment sort of overall of where we are with our national security toolkit?\", \"gen. mcmaster: i think we're in good shape thanks to the extremely dedicated civil servants and military professionals, intelligence professionals who we have across our government. but i think what is needed more than anything is a higher degree of what i argue in \", \" is, strategic competence, and that's the ability to integrate the elements of national power so that they're applied in a way that are synergistic. the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. i think at times we get it right, but most often we get it wrong. and our approach to these complex problems is fragmented. it's inconsistent. it's as i mentioned, you know, based on flawed assumptions about the nature of the problem. i think what i would like to see as well these days is even more of a concerted effort to foster multinational cooperation as i write in \", \". i mean, none of these problems are solvable by any one country. so it's very important for us to create the right venues for us to come together. not only to work on a discrete issue or event together, but really to think about these complex challenges. to frame them together and then to apply our competitive advantages between our like minded countries. so that we do have a synergistic effect and and so that we can build a better future for generations to come.\", \"michael morrell: the last question, i think anybody who's listened to the podcast up to this point is going to think, wow, that is a hard, tough list. i wonder at the end of the day, if you're optimistic or if you are pessimistic that we're going to get this right going forward.\", \"gen. mcmaster: michael, i'm optimistic about it. i'm optimistic about it even as we emerge from this\\xa0 triple crisis. of the pandemic, the recession associated with it and the divides in our society, laid bare by george floyds murder and the protests and civil unrest that followed it. i think what's great about our democracy is we are self-correcting. the american people have a say in how they're governed. they can demand better. and the reason i wrote \", \" is i think if the american people understand these challenges, they will demand a better foreign policy from from our elected leaders. you know, our founders knew that our democracy was going to require continuous nurturing. it's still true today. and i believe that we do have significant problems at home. but we also have to confront these challenges abroad because we know from the covid-19 pandemic that problems that develop abroad can only be dealt with at an exorbitant price once they reach our shores. so the argument of battlegrounds is an argument for sustained engagement with the world.\", 'michael morrell: the book is ', \".' the author is h.r. mcmaster. general, thank you very much for joining us today.\", 'gen. mcmaster: michael, thank you for

york times was getting ready to report on ', ' that attempted to sabotage north korea’s missile programs with cyberstrikes. “is this the revelation of the modern-day enigma codes?” he asked, the military historian searching for an analogy from the world war ii operation to crack german ciphers.', 'it was a bracing start for what turned out to be a wild 13-month effort to devise a modern-day security strategy for a president with no experience, more interest in cutting deals than designing a long-term strategy — and an unwillingness to sit for intelligence briefings, much less discussion of containing an angry, decaying russia or of a 50-year plan to compete with a rising china. so “battlegrounds” is, at its heart, the mcmaster strategic plan that might have come to fruition had he worked for a president who was interested in strategic plans.', 'long before he walked into the west wing, mcmaster was the closest thing the army had to a soldier-scholar. his book about vietnam, ', ' was a devastating account of how the united states had a flawed decision-making process that was largely based on self-deception.', 'in many ways, “battlegrounds” is the sequel, seeking to ask the question of why — not whether — the united states, at another moment of protests in the streets and bitter partisan divides, is losing its ability to shape the world. but the answers this time are different, in mcmaster’s view.', 'the key to his argument is that america is suffering from what hans morgenthau called “strategic narcissism,” or, in mcmaster’s words, “the tendency to view the world only in relation to the united states and to assume that the future course of events depends primarily on u.s. decisions or plans.” it’s hard to argue with that premise: every new president comes to office assuming that the world is waiting for direction from washington. some countries are. others are looking for power vacuums they can fill, each in its own way.', 'that’s been the story of the past two decades. russia has emerged as a disrupter, knowing that it has neither the money nor the technology to take the united states on directly. china has become a builder — why threaten to cut undersea cables, as vladimir putin’s submarine force does, if you can dominate global communications? as rob joyce, an n.s.a. official who worked for mcmaster as the white house cybersecurity coordinator, said: “russia is the hurricane. … china is climate change.”', 'mcmaster realized that, and devoted much of his time in the west wing to writing a “national security strategy” that would reorient the united states away from nearly two decades of counterterrorism and toward countering moscow and beijing, which he called “revisionist powers.” it was an impressive document. unfortunately, the president under whose name it was published, aides concede, did not read it.', '“battlegrounds” expands on the written strategy — the one the white house has barely mentioned since it was published — and makes a strong case for containing russia, pushing back on chinese influence and using american leverage, and allies, to confront iran and north korea. what washington needs, mcmaster argues, is an integrated approach that recognizes that the old tools that drove saddam hussein out of kuwait in 1991, when mcmaster served, are pretty useless 30 years later.', 'he starts with russia. “the united states and europe were ill prepared for russia’s toxic combination of disinformation, denial, dependence and disruptive technologies,” he says, a recognition that what happened in 2016 was not that america’s radar was off. it’s that the radar was never built. fortunately, it has since been pieced together, and in the 2020 presidential contest, everyone from facebook to twitter to the united states cyber command has been pushing back. disinformation has been blocked, clumsily. ', ', at least briefly.', 'unfortunately, mcmaster’s boss was not on board with this approach. in mcmaster’s time, he notes, president trump often said improving relations with russia “would be a good thing, not a bad thing,” while succumbing to putin’s flattery and treating his criminal actions “with dismissiveness and moral equivalency.” and, of course, the repeated references to “the russia hoax,” which meant no one in the president’s circle could discuss election interference without dreading an eruption triggered by trump’s fear that the legitimacy of the election was being questioned.', 'mcmaster never deals head-on with the fundamental problem — that the administration had, on paper, a defensible russia strategy, and the president kept undermining it. instead, he cites his top russia aide, fiona hill, who, he writes, always warned that “putin seeks to divide; americans and europeans should not divide themselves.”', 'china, the climate-changer, is, of course, immune to containment strategies. if the old cold war was largely a military contest, version 2.0 is a military, diplomatic, economic and technological contest. that change led to a misappraisal of the challenge: as mcmaster points out, a succession of administrations convinced themselves that, over time, china would conform to a western-built system. (trump succumbed to a different illusion: that the chinese were all dealmakers, like the property developers he knew.)', 'crucial to mcmaster’s analysis is china’s strategy to wire together its own collection of allies and dependent powers — selling them controlled-in-china technology, from huawei’s networks to, after mcmaster departed, tiktok’s addictive app.', '“it took the united states a decade and a half to understand the immensity of the trojan horse it had let in,” he says of how the united states blindly let a chinese telecommunications giant gain ground, while american firms exited the market. but the reader yearns for mcmaster’s solution. ban chinese technology? maybe — president trump is trying — but even then china will dominate 40 percent or more of the world’s telecommunications networks. embrace an industrial policy that will win back the market?', 'it is in dealing with the two biggest failures of the trump administration, iran and north korea, that mcmaster sounds the loudest alarms. while he was a major critic of president obama’s 2015 nuclear deal with tehran, and criticizes obama’s aides for overlooking iran’s support of terrorism and terrorist regimes, he reports that internally he argued for staying inside the deal and using trump’s threats to toss it aside as leverage.', 'but the president wouldn’t think that many chess moves ahead, and dispensed with the whole deal a month after mcmaster left. now he fears that the united states, without allies to confront iran, may slip into the place we are with other nuclear powers that washington once declared could never possess nuclear arms:', '“pakistan provides a stark warning. iran could become, like pakistan today, a nuclear-armed state in which terrorists already enjoy a support base. the greatest threat to humanity in the coming decades may lie at the nexus between terrorists and the most destructive weapons on earth.”', 'north korea, of course, already has those weapons — and a lot more fuel for them now than when the trump administration arrived with its threats of “fire and fury” if they were not turned over immediately. it was the president’s ego that got in the way.', 'mcmaster knew, he says, that as soon as kim jong-un proposed a summit, the president “would find a historic first meeting between a north korean leader and a u.s. president irresistible.” not a single weapon or missile has been dismantled. but the sanctions regime is in tatters, undercut by russia and china.', 'which takes me back to mcmaster’s question his first day: are we facing the “modern-day enigma codes”? it turns out the enigma this time is us. americans want the unrivaled power, the global influence, and the economic growth and freedom that come with it, the kind we enjoyed with little challenge at the end of world war ii and then, briefly, after the collapse of the soviet union. but we want it free — without the strategic investments in the world, without forward-deployed troops, without marshaling the power of technologies america largely invented.', 'the biggest of mcmaster’s “battlegrounds” is here at home.', 'advertisement']['from ', ' to

institute for scholars, president vladimir putin and his top advisers only have themselves to blame for these crises on russia’s periphery, given their active assertion of “veto rights” over political outcomes that they find unfavorable, including any signs that a country is realigning away from russia and toward the west.', 'in many cases, this has meant staunch russian support for friendly authoritarian regimes in post-soviet states, leading to mass demonstrations or other forms of unrest. “in a way,” rojansky told wpr’s elliot waldman in an interview on the trend lines podcast this

missile that is reported to have a reach of 54nm (100km). in theory, if a fourth-generation fighter like the rafale has an aesa radar and is armed with a beyond-visual-range missile like the meteor it ought to be able to see and hit incoming russian aircraft, while staying out of reach itself.', 'however, beside the addition of aesa on the rafales, other european fourth-generation aircraft lack the advanced radar.', '“uncertainties remain as to which nations will invest in aesa radar technology, advanced and long-range munitions, and secure communication links, among other important capabilities,” says rand. “the degree to which european air forces acquire these technologies will directly impact their ability to contribute to the range of combat air missions expected in a high-intensity conflict.”', 'for its part, the uk royal air force announced in september plans to add the ecrs mk2 aesa radar to 40 examples of its tranche 3 production-standard typhoons, with initial operational capability targeted for 2025.', 'ultimately, to make the most of a mixed fleet of fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft nato will need to invest in communications technologies to link the jets, as well as training exercises to practice coordinating the combat aircraft.', 'f-35’s can communicate among themselves with their multifunction advanced data link (madl), a low probability of intercept communications link. rand points to a fourth and fifth generation fighter operating concept called “combat intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (isr) mode” described by justin bronk of the royal united services institute think tank.', '“in the ‘combat isr’ mode, a four-ship flight of f-35s connected by madl generates situational awareness and shares targeting data with legacy platforms that can then fire their payloads from outside the range of the most capable of the enemy’s air defences,” explains rand. the fourth- and fifth-generation combat aircraft would communicate and pass targeting information with the link 16 system, adds the report.', 'however, this might be a vulnerability point. “it is reasonable to assume that the russian military would seek to disrupt this synergy during a conflict, particularly in light of recent russian investments in ew capabilities,” rand says.', 'still, european nato militaries are getting more practice with the f-35. “already, allies have undertaken initial steps to establish common tactics, techniques, and procedures for incorporating fifth-generation assets into combined operations through targeted exercises as well as preliminary synthetic training systems that link fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft,” the think tank says.', 'one of the highest hurdles to nato collaboration might be investment in aircraft readiness. “to be operationally relevant during a theatre conflict, nato’s air forces must maintain a sufficient number of available aircraft, munitions, and aircrew,” says rand. “currently, most european air forces maintain around half of their existing fleets or less at mission-capable status, with some allies falling below that mark.”', 'what’s more, many fourth-generation aircraft are suffering from “rising maintenance costs from platform age, operational wear and tear resulting from a high operational tempo, and challenges associated with spare parts pipelines serve as significant constraints to aircraft availability”, says the report.', 'the new f-35 also has teething problems, including its autonomic logistics information system, a support system that is so troubled that it has to be replaced across the worldwide fleet.', 'rand recommends a number of solutions to nato aircraft readiness problems including making public data on mission capable rates. it also suggests “public agreement by nato leaders on standard availability objectives could provide renewed political and budgetary focus on efficient and adequately funded maintenance and sustainment”.', 'ultimately, rand concludes that the growing number of stealth aircraft in europe means the “trend lines lead in the right direction”.', '“with additional budgetary and policy attention to increasing readiness, european allies have the opportunity to significantly enhance combat airpower over the coming decade,” says the think tank.', 'the dod had expressed confidence as recently as august that

2014. still, up until last summer, germany has been looking for topics on which it could engage with russia, in the hopes that keeping the lines of communication open would have some good effects and help make the world a safer place.', 'none of these approaches has worked recently. this is because, in a world in flux, moscow sees them all as fleeting theoretical constructs that are not fit to invest in, let alone build on. russian policymakers dismiss the lithuanian theory as a fantasy based on past dreams: moscow does not believe in the normative framework that forms its basis and, if it did, would fight against it.', 'the french theory goes nowhere because moscow does understand who macron speaks for: himself, france, or europe. moscow sees his ideas as unrealistic and domestically driven. and, in any case, russia has no intention of limiting its freedom of action by prematurely siding with europe, especially given that it does not know whether the european union will become a policy actor to reckon with – or even if it is here to stay.', 'russia’s scepticism about europe may also explain the dismal fate of the german theory. moscow has recently allowed its disputes with berlin to pile up in ways that may cost it its best european friend – apparently just because it does not care to save or invest in a relationship with germany and, by implication, europe.', 'the us election result will affect the relative standing of these theories. a biden win might embolden the lithuanian theory, put the french theory on the defensive, and, depending on the circumstances, lend new energy to germany’s attempts to create patches of common ground in the west’s otherwise normatively adversarial relationship with russia (not to be confused with appeasement, which is a different thing entirely). proponents of each theory would seek to strengthen it by coordinating and cooperating with a biden administration, and they would want to help the new president succeed using their favoured approach (which would be different from trump’s). but, even so, moscow would likely remain reluctant to buy into any of this.\\xa0', 'this is not to say that it does not matter to russia who wins the us election. moscow does not have great expectations regarding either president, but the outcome will nonetheless have an impact on russia’s view on the direction the world is heading in. a second trump presidency would validate what, according to some russian experts, has always been putin’s world view: “instinctively, he is nationalist, unilateralist, and transactional”, ', ' one russian analyst in december 2018. “for him, this is how the world works, and he wants to be vindicated. he wants to be able to tell the west he has always been right.”', 'a biden win would clash with this view. it would show the kremlin that the normative ideas that have underpinned the western policies are not dead; that they might make a comeback and, importantly, adapt to new realities. but adaptation cannot be taken for granted, and would inevitably take time. so, in either case, moscow will continue to see us policies as provisional – as a part of a temporary phase that one needs to wait out, to see what follows. moscow would view trump as a destroyer of the liberal system – and would welcome this – but not as an architect of a new system that it could engage with. and moscow would inevitably suspect a biden presidency of being just the last gasp of the former liberal consensus.', 'the more biden urged a restoration of obama-era policies – not to mention those of the clinton era – the more moscow would see his actions as the death throes of a dying order and, as such, something to resist or ignore. conversely, the stronger biden proved in acknowledging that the world had changed, and that western policy needed to change too, the more seriously moscow would take him as a figure who could shape the future.', 'the task is to find a way of shaping the world – including influencing russia – in the circumstances where the western ‘unipolar’ moment of the 1990s has passed, and even 500 years of relative western hegemony might be drawing to a close. this takes humility, caution, and a clear head. emotionally driven policies and rushed solutions do not fit. in a seminal study exploring the lessons that the soviet collapse might offer to the european union, ivan krastev ', ' that, “in times of threats of disintegration, political actors should bet on flexibility and constrain their natural urge for rigidity and solutions intended to last (which, if and when they fail, can accelerate the momentum to disintegration).” this applies to the disintegration of the international order as well. attempts to forcefully recreate yesterday’s order will almost certainly lead to its final discreditation. efforts to build something new, forcefully and prematurely, will be stillborn. a fruitful policy requires a humble mindset and an understanding that, to shape the world order, the west needs to start at home, by making its own societies work; by remaking them. this will take time – but it has a chance of working.', '\\nthe european council on foreign

last saw each other at the beginning of this year in january. among other things, it’s prevented me from going to st. petersburg in my first 10 or 11 months as ambassador, which i was looking forward to. i haven’t been there since 1988. and i was looking forward to visiting the hermitage, among other things.', 'so you’ve referenced this grant that we’ve made through the ambassadors fund for cultural preservation to support the hermitage. and i can give you a little bit a little bit of detail on that. the project is actually a partnership among four organizations. there’s this ambassador’s fund for cultural preservation, which is part of the state department’s bureau of educational and cultural affairs. that’s one. and then there’s our role at the u.s. embassy. and you mentioned the hermitage foundation, which is based in new york city. and then finally, there’s the state hermitage museum in st. petersburg. and among all four of these, these organizations, we came together to come up with a project to restore three frescoes of the raphael school as part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the death of raphael.', 'and that’s what we’re focused on. these frescoes were painted between 1523 and 1524, on the wall of a villa in italy, and they were actually acquired by the hermitage in 1860. but over the past 500 years, the frescoes have suffered considerable exposure to the elements and prior restoration efforts were imperfect. so the program that we’re sponsoring, is to restore those frescoes which is urgently needed. and as i say it’s done in connection with the 500th anniversary of raphael’s death. and we’re hopeful that after they’re restored, that there will be really an unveiling of the true beauty of the frescoes not just to the russian public, but to the world. which is, you know, the hermitage museum is, of course, a cultural treasure of russia, but really, of the world. i mean, the hermitage is such a – literally – a treasure of art and culture.', 'so with this grant we’re doing, the program is done – we’ve been working with the executive director of the hermitage foundation and i want to credit her, saranna biel-cohen [working] on behalf of the foundation, and of course the director of the hermitage museum, mikhail piotrovsky. i want to credit them for their hard work on this project. and next week on october 28, the foundation, the museum, and myself, the embassy, will have a virtual launch of the project, and anybody, any of your readers or you, if you’re interested, it’ll be at 5pm on wednesday, the 28th. and we’ll learn more about the frescoes, how they’ll be restored, and the cultural significance.', ' very good. and could you say a couple of words about this ambassador’s fund for cultural preservation? as i understand it is a deliberate foundation to preserve treasures cultural treasures throughout the world.', ' yes, indeed, it was established, [nineteen] years ago [in 2001]. it’s a program that’s operated in over 100 countries. and it’s managed out of the state department in washington. and there is a process to review proposals and get approval from the department of state to provide the funding. so this program that we submitted on behalf of the hermitage foundation and the hermitage, was in a competition against hundreds of other proposals from other u.s. embassies worldwide. and the fact that this project won this grant is a sign both of the significance of the project itself, and of the cultural partnership between the united states and russia. and this will be i think, the [seventh] project that we have funded in russia over the last 20 years or so. so it’s an important sign of the cultural bonds between the united states and russia', ' very good. you’re lucky that you prepared the good papers. and we are lucky, of course, russians that this will be restored. and may i ask you some questions about other cultural people to people, so to say, relations between russia and america, like sisters cities program, or the u.s.-russia business cooperation, or cooperation in space, arctic, because there are a lot of dimensions of coexistence, rather only all the military and strategic ones.', ' well, konstantin, you’re absolutely right. and i would say, you know, there are relations between the u.s. government and the government of the russian federation, whether it’s on strategic and military issues, political issues, and we all know how fraught those relations have been over the last several years in particular. but there’s a much broader relationship between the united states and russia between our peoples, including cultural and educational exchanges, in business, in space, in the arctic, and a small topic that i like to emphasize, but my colleagues here at the embassy are probably sick of hearing me talk about – ice hockey – which is a personal interest of mine. but it’s those connections, i think, konstantin that are among the most significant that we have. and they are a bond that keeps us together, when the political situation seems most dire. and one thing i’ve observed in my tenure here is how much the relationship between the united states and russia has changed, just in my professional lifetime.', 'you know, i came i mentioned earlier in our conversation that i visited st. petersburg in 1988. i was a private u.s. citizen had a great interest in russia and russian history. i visited moscow, what was then leningrad, but i visited the soviet union then, and i visited leningrad, not st. petersburg. and if you think of all that’s happened in our relationship between our two countries over the last 30 to 35 years, how things have changed, the ups and downs, what’s grown has been the cultural, business, all of those ties between our two peoples that have grown dramatically.', 'and that distinguishes this era, from that sort of late soviet era that i grew up in, in the 70s and 80s, when we didn’t have those many ties that keep us together, when the political sea gets choppy. so now, for example, we have more than 1,000 u.s. businesses invested in doing business here in russia. and that means russians and americans working together. it’s not just the bolshoi traveling to new york and performing in new york city, or, you know, an equivalent theatre company coming from the united states and performing here. it is day to day personal interaction between colleagues in business. and that’s significant. and it provides a little more ballast for the relationship, when, as i say, the political seas, can get choppy.', 'but as those of us who are old enough, with some perspective, can look back over the last three or four decades and see how our relationship has changed. our counterparts 20 or 30 years from now, the u.s. ambassador and your successor, you know, i’m sure they’ll be remarking too on how much things have changed since 2020. and the relationship between the united states and russia remember those dark old days with, you know, with ukraine – crimea – and syria, and libya, and nagorno-karabakh, and belarus, and election interference and cyber this – and god knows what our successors are going to be talking about 35 years from now. but what i will say is, the fact that we have made the connections that we’ve made over the last 30 or 35 years in business, in the arts, in sports and entertainment, will make it more likely that it’s a positive outcome and more positive developments. not just focused on the day to day negativity.', ' yeah, you mentioned the amazing figure that a thousand u.s. businesses are dealing with russia, despite all the sanctions and all the risks connected with sanctions. and our cooperation between military in syria also exist and they exchange information. so i really share your view that the infrastructure of many, many spheres of interrelations is a good support to these big politics.', ' and part of that, you’re absolutely right, a part of that infrastructure is something you mentioned, konstantin – sister city partnerships. we’ve got a large number. this is a program that’s been in existence for decades, established by and managed by the u.s. government. so there’s an official u.s. government relationship that’s involved here.', '[note: sister cities international is a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) nonprofit which serves as the national membership organization for individual sister cities, counties, and states across the united states. sister cities international was created at president eisenhower’s 1956 white house summit on citizen diplomacy. but it is an independent, nongovernmental organization. end note.]', 'but these sister city relationships, you know, date back into soviet times, into the 1970s when i think the first five sister city relationships happened. and now, you know, we’ve got cities all across the united states that are joined with cities across russia, so sarasota, florida and vladimir, for example. burlington, vermont and yaroslavl, louisville, kentucky and perm, chicago and moscow. and it’s, you know, it’s a small thing, but it’s an important part of our relationship. and, i’d also make the link with business as well, konstantin, because what we’ve done here at the embassy, and my colleagues at the u.s. department of commerce, and our counterparts at the ministry of trade, is that we have made connections, business-to-business connections, with regions and cities in the united states.', 'because of covid, we had to do this virtually, but we were planning a trade mission from texas – texas companies and the government of the state of texas – to the yekaterinburg in the ural region. we had to do it because of covid, we did it virtually, but it was a full day event. the government of the state of texas was involved, the governor of the state himself. and making those types of regional connections for business, i think is a is a profitable way forward. and i’ve spoken to secretary ross, our secretary of commerce, about this. and i know that the secretary himself had a phone call recently with trade minister manturov. and that’s an area where we’re going to continue to pursue making those connections regionally, as well, not just government-to-government.', ' very important, because a lot of asymmetric information is available in regions. people wants to do something, but they lack adequate information. so thank you for that effort in yekaterinburg, because it’s our industrial, i think, number three or number four, city in russian. do you have any plans for cooperation in the arctic because arctic seems to attract attention.', ' yes, it’s a very relevant and timely topic in our relationship, konstantin, because, as you know, russia will take over the chair of the arctic council in just a few months in 2021. and the arctic council is a very important institution that promotes this vital region, as a zone of cooperation free from conflict. and the council itself is an institution where we can discuss sustainable development, the environment, protection and development of indigenous peoples. and it’s a shared interest of the united states, russia – russia, of course, has a huge chunk of the arctic region within its northern border – but the united states, canada, the other members of the countries that border the arctic region, we all have a shared interest in its development and its protection. and so my colleagues in washington and our embassy here have been engaged directly with the russian government, with the ministry of foreign affairs in particular. i met with first deputy foreign minister titov a couple of months ago, to talk about arctic cooperation and russia’s role assuming the chair of the arctic council. and those discussions have continued between our two governments, between washington and moscow, and the pace of interaction will increase as we get closer to 2021 when russia does assume the chair.', 'okay, thank you. and the last question, but our younger audience is always interested about student exchange. and now with covid, a lot of zoom classes may have. but still, what is number of russians which are enrolled in american universities and colleges?', 'well, terrific question. and i could guess, off the top of my head, but what i’m going to propose is that we get back to you with the precise figures for your publication.', '[note: the latest open doors report shows that for the 2018-2019 academic year, more than 5,000 russians studied in the us. we do not have the figures for current enrollment in online programs. end note.]', 'but what i would offer, konstantin, is we had – i participated in a virtual program, that the united states government, that we the embassy helped organize. we usually do it in person, we bring over representatives from colleges and universities in the united states. and they come here to russia, to moscow to other cities, and they’re available to russian families, russian students, parents, who are interested in having a student study in the united states. because of covid, we weren’t able to do that in person. we did it virtually.', 'but here’s the benefit, though, of that, if there’s a silver lining, we got many more u.s. colleges and universities able to participate virtually, who wouldn’t have been able to, to send either afford to or couldn’t send somebody, to participate in a program in in moscow. so what that meant was that the russian students and their families that were interested and participated got a wide variety of much wider variety of u.s. colleges and universities presented and interested in recruiting them to study in the united states. and i know you yourself studied at penn. i won’t embarrass you by saying how many years ago it was, but i was long out of college myself by then. so we’re, neither of us is a youngster anymore. but you yourself can testify to the benefit of study abroad, and getting to know another country, and seeing how their education system works.', 'and i know a number of my colleagues here at the embassy, have studied at russian institutions, russian language, russian culture. so it’s a key component, and has been for a long time, and we’re really looking to, to encourage that. and it’s always fun to meet russians who have studied in the united states and compare notes about their experience, with our expectations. i will say, and these were, these were my remarks, and i wasn’t just trying to flatter the russian participants. it’s a fact that we hear from us colleges and universities, that russian students are among the most desired, are the most serious, hardworking, and just great additions to the student body, which isn’t this surprise for those of us who know or aspire to know, to know russia. it’s an important part of our relationship, the broader relationship between our two peoples. and we certainly want to encourage it, and we’re doing all we can, in the face of the covid pandemic, to make sure that those relationships continue, and that they don’t wither or diminish just because we’re not able to have in person interaction. so my hope is that we’ll have a large number of russian students traveling to the united states and enriching our schools and our campuses as you did in the 80s in philadelphia.', '\\xa0thank you. and i, personally, i am very grateful to you for supporting this students’ exchange. because, you know, if you live in the country, it is so difficult to influence you, in pushing any misperceptions, [to engage you in a] witch hunt. and it helps to understand the nature of people. and since 33 years ago, i returned back from philadelphia. you know, i keep this interest towards america i read every day american papers, i read american books, i watch american television, i watched the debate. \\xa0tonight i put down notes, who said what, what is the argument of that.', 'and this is something very profound in our sympathy and relations and desire to improve it. because i belong to that part of russian society, and i always openly said at every level that we believe that good relations with america can benefit russian people in medicine, in science, in culture, in sports, in engineering, in business, benefit it. it could be rather selfish from this point of view, but it is beneficial. it’s not hostile. and i wish that you in your position of ambassador put all your efforts, pursue the line in these dark, dark days of covid and the distraction of regular relationships.', ' oh, you’re so right. and i had a great experience a few months ago now. and i can add to all of the categories you listed, law and the legal profession. so i spoke to law students. it was probably a couple of hundred. it was a virtual, a virtual event i did it by zoom or some other electronic means which my colleagues are much better able to describe and make function than i. i just sit in front of the camera and talk. but what was fascinating was, for many of those students, i was the first american that they really had a chance to engage with in their young lives. and we had a lot in common. we talked about our legal education. some of their professors were on the call. and we got to share a few comments about law professors, and what it was like joining a profession, what their expectations were. and it’s just an example in our lives. i know we’ve both experienced this.', 'russians and americans, there are so many things that we have in common, whether we’re engineers, or ballet dancers, or hockey players, or authors, or lawyers. people are people, and the more that we can have these exchanges, trade experiences, explore how our systems are different and how they’re similar. it breaks down stereotypes, and it just makes things between our two countries, makes the relationship stronger, and makes it more difficult for political winds to blow the relationship in a really dangerous direction. the more we understand each other, the better we’ll be able to overcome some of these differences which would separate us now.', 'yeah, thank you, mr. ambassador. do you know what i noticed that what you talked today was actually about the substance of russian-american relations, because usually, a lot of experts view the need of russia to america and vice versa only as a means to solve some others country’s problems, like, we need russia to solve problem in north korea, or in iran, or in afghanistan, or it’s here, but it’s never a table which belongs to us. all spheres, which you mentioned, just belong to russia, and america, in every aspect. and i think it is most valuable in this relation that we have the body of mutual interest. and thank you for understanding that and pursuing this line.', 'well, you’re so right. and it’s not to diminish the importance of those geopolitical issues which i spend, you know, the vast amount of my time focused on and i know you write about, and we’re all interested in, and they’re extremely important to the world and global security and peace and prosperity. but if we’re talking about the united states and russia, it’s not just those issues. and our relationship has a long history. i was joking with the first deputy foreign minister titov, we were we were talking about the arctic. and i commented on the fact that i have to thank russia, then the russian empire, for giving the united states a stake in the arctic by selling us alaska. right?', 'so our relationship goes back a long, long way to when secretary of state seward purchased alaska, and made us a part of eventually the arctic council. but we shared a laugh over that. but it just an example of over time, the united states and russia, we have to deal with each other on these political issues, but on a broader level, people to people, we have stronger ties now than we did when i was growing up in the 60s and 70s, and 80s. people to people ties, educational, and so forth. the political issues are as challenging and maybe even more challenging in some ways than they were for my predecessors 40 or 50 years ago when it was the soviet union versus the west and the united states. but in any event, as long as we keep talking about positive things like this, it will give us more space to try to work out the more difficult political issues as well.', 'thank you very much for this interview and looking forward to talk with you on some other issues, maybe later, because there were a lot of substantial things you conveyed.\\xa0 it’s very important for our people, because they’re asymmetrically informed about the positions because they don’t understand how profound is your access to your job and your mission as ambassador here.', 'well, thank you, konstantin. i look forward to continuing this conversation, i hope in person soon but if not, continuing through zoom. so look forward to speaking again soon.',

navigation satellite to an orbit nearly 12,000 miles above earth on saturday.', 'the new satellite joins 24 active navigation spacecraft in the glonass fleet, russia’s analog to the u.s. military’s global positioning system.', 'the mission took off at 3:08:42 p.m. edt (1908:42 gmt) saturday aboard a russian soyuz-2.1b rocket from the plesetsk cosmodrome, a military-run launch base around 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of moscow, according to the russian ministry of defense.', 'liftoff occurred at 10:08 p.m. moscow time.', 'heading southeast from plesetsk, the soyuz rocket shed its four kerosene-fueled boosters around two minutes after liftoff, then jettisoned the aerodynamic shroud covering the glonass satellite after reaching space. the soyuz core stage shut down and separated around five minutes into the mission, followed by ignition of the third stage’s rd-0124 engine.', 'the third stage engine cut off about nine minutes after liftoff, and the mission’s fregat upper stage deployed to begin a series of maneuvers to place the glonass satellite its targeted orbit.', 'the fregat engine ignited three times to place the glonass payload into a circular orbit with\\xa0an altitude of more than 11,900 miles (19,100 kilometers) and an inclination of 64.8 degrees. the fregat upper stage released the glonass spacecraft around three-and-a-half hours after liftoff.', 'russian officials said the glonass satellite extended its solar panels, and ground teams established contact with the spacecraft. all systems on-board the satellite were functioning normally after launch saturday, officials said.', 'the payload launched saturday is the third spacecraft in russia’s glonass k series of navigation satellites, which engineers designed\\xa0to last longer and transmit more navigation signals. the first two glonass k satellites launched in 2011 and 2014.', 'the glonass k satellites weigh around 2,060 pounds, or 935 kilograms, somewhat less than the earlier generation glonass m satellites.', 'the glonass k satellite is expected to operate for 10 years — an improvement from the seven-year design life of previous satellites — and features five navigation channels, including a new civilian l-band signal. the new craft are lighter, generate more electrical power, and are based on an unpressurized express 1000k bus built by iss reshetnev\\xa0in\\xa0zheleznogorsk, russia.', 'the glonass k spacecraft will also support the international cospas-sarsat search and rescue network, russian officials said.', 'the satellite launched saturday also uses more russian-built equipment than previous glonass spacecraft, a change introduced to the glonass k design due to international sanctions on russia.', '“replacing the orbital constellation with glonass k spacecraft will ensure the stable operation of the russian navigation system and increase the accuracy of its navigation determinations up to tens of centimeters,” the russian defense ministry said in a statement.', 'as of monday, the glonass fleet consists of 24 active satellites, plus the new spacecraft launched saturday, and three more operating as a spare, undergoing maintenance, and performing fight tests. the network, which is run by the russian military but also used by civilians worldwide, requires 24 satellites in service spread among three orbital planes to provide global navigation coverage.', 'the russian ministry of defense was expected to name the new glonass satellite kosmos 2547, keeping with the naming scheme for russian military spacecraft.'\n"

      "presidents george bush and barack_obama when elected both thought they could establish rapport with leader vladimir_putin and dramatically improve relations their appraisal of putin swiftly changed when asked his impression of putin after his face to face meeting george bush looked the man in the eye found him very straightforward and trustworthy was able to get sense of his soul obama eight years later openly sought reset in relations only to see his hopes dashed finally with annexation of the ukrainian peninsula crimea in joe_biden who as obama vice_president supported the reset strategy is unlikely to follow the example of his predecessors former diplomats and analysts biden indicated as during his presidential campaign saying at cnn town hall last_month believe is an opponent really do in contrast he called china competitor serious competitor during the presidential campaign biden sought to differentiate himself president donald_trump regarding accusing his republican rival of being soft on putin trump and his aides pushed with the president saying in august the last person wants to see in office is donald_trump because nobody been tougher on than have early last_month biden criticized his opponent for remaining silent on the poisoning of opposition_leader alexei navalny which he bluntly blamed on the moscow government once again the kremlin has used favorite weapon an agent the novichok class of chemicals in an effort to silence political opponent he it is the mark of regime that is so paranoid that it is unwilling to tolerate any criticism or dissent but candidates can thing during campaign and do something else once in office sometimes they have little choice because of circumstances or the course of events president joe_biden pursue as muscular an approach to as he has suggested dont biden is going to fall head over heels to butter up putin david kramer who was an assistant secretary of state in the administration of george bush moscow has continued with disinformation campaign against him and so dont hes going to extend hand and lets nice added kramer fellow at the mccain institute foreign_policy tank based in washington mean no reset don he going to try anything like kramer in reference to obama failed reset policy kramer thinks biden have to focus largely on domestic issues thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact and to the extent he is able to focus on foreign_policy should not be at the high end of the priority list he told voa although he added you cant ignore it and it is factor in number of problems we face hes going to have to devote his limited when it comes to foreign_policy to work with countries that are ready to solve problems by that he means shoring up america transatlantic alliance biden and putin have met cordiality in interview with magazine biden at meeting he told the leader looking into your eyes and don you have soul biden continued he looked at me and he smiled and he we understand another aside the lack of personal rapport analysts any effort to reset relations would be complicated by economic sanctions on imposed by both the obama and trump administrations the measures leave biden with little room to maneuver and are unlikely to be lifted while western powers believe is mounting cyberattacks against them former western diplomats antagonism is likely to persist between washington and moscow as as the kremlin seeks to undermine western democratic institutions last_week former top security_adviser to british prime_minister boris johnson mark sedwill revealed that britain has launched series of covert cyber based attacks on leaders and their interests to impose price greater than they might have expected for their cyber offensive against the west other allied powers the are doing so too western intelligence officials in what is becoming like for like cyber conflict with the kremlin in the so called gray space the gap between normal state relations and armed conflict the and other western powers are in conflict with on range of issues the annexation of crimea to the pro moscow agitation in east ukraine backing of syria president bashar al assad to the attempted assassination in salisbury england of former double agent sergei skripal heather williams of britain chatham house expects biden administration to focus on key areas restoring arms_control and strengthening nato to check adventurism on the hand the must maintain strong deterrent and restore credibility with its allies at the same it must pursue arms_control and other risk reduction opportunities she in the final days of the presidential_election the kremlin appeared to be hedging its bets on who might win republican campaigners as as president trump had been hurling corruption charges at biden son hunter over his service on the board of an energy company in ukraine and business dealings with china but putin dodged an opportunity to amplify the allegations against hunter biden saying yes in ukraine he had or maybe still has business it doesn concern us it concerns the americans and the ukrainians don see anything criminal about this the leader has also sought to highlight possible common ground with biden especially over nuclear arms_control putin called this month for the last existing nuclear arms_control pact between and the to be saved proposing to extend the start treaty that set to expire in february it would be extremely sad if the treaty ceases to exist he the treaty was signed in by barack_obama and then president dmitry medvedev the pact limits each country to no more than deployed nuclear warheads and deployed missiles and bombers during his career in the senate biden was champion of nuclear arms_control and he has promised to seek to extend the start treaty saying he would likely accept offer to extend it for five years as candidate joe_biden he would reverse of the foreign_policy initiatives of the trump administration such as withdrawing the united_states international agreements and work to repair the transatlantic relationship that he contends has been the key to stability in europe over the past years he has he would tougher stand on expressed strong support for ukraine and would rejoin the nuclear agreement with iran if tehran holds up its end of the deal former vice_president and senator who served nearly years in washington biden believes the united_states can best tackle global threats by leading alliances of democratic states he he would immediate steps upon entering office to strengthen alliances and once more have america lead the world however biden be faced with major domestic problems in deeply divided country the coronavirus pandemic high unemployment racial tension and growing inequality that prompt him to put his foreign_policy initiatives on the burner analysts analysts have it could the biden administration several months to put together its entire foreign_policy team and set more specific priorities biden has he would seek to repair transatlantic ties which he asserts president donald_trump has damaged by repeatedly criticizing the european union and nato slapping tariffs on some european goods and withdrawing international agreements in contrast to trump who in called nato obsolete biden has called it the most effective political military alliance in modern history and it must remain strоng while adapting to kinds of threats to counter aggression we must keep the alliance military capabilities sharp while also expanding its capacity to on nontraditional threats such as weaponized corruption disinformation and cybertheft he wrote in the journal earlier in in an article setting out his positions on range of issues biden has he would tougher stand against president_vladimir putin and has called moscow an opponent as as the biggest threat to the security of the united_states today he has criticized the kremlin for actions the seizure of crimea and for its role in the war between kyiv and backed separatists in ukraine donbas region he has also accused it of interfering in elections and of being behind attacks on journalists and civil_society leaders trump rarely criticized the kremlin unlike trump ll defend our democratic values and stand up to autocrats like putin biden in tweet in august he has also threatened to punish moscow if it interfered in the election and rejected trumps idea of inviting into the group of seven leading industrialized countries we must impose real costs on for its violations of international norms and stand with civil_society which has bravely stood up and again against putin kleptocratic authoritarian system he wrote in the foreign affairs article biden supports the cancelation of the kremlin backed nord stream pipeline to carry natural gas to germany opponents of the pipeline it would deprive ukraine of significant transit fees and increase european reliance on energy exports biden who was obamas point man on ukraine as vice_president has expressed strong support for ukraines independence and integration with europe and has backed sending lethal weapons to kyiv to help it battle the backed separatists biden has he would extend start the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with while pursuing negotiations on pact start which imposes limits on the countries strategic nuclear arsenals expires in february but can be extended by up to five years by mutual agreement the trump administration has rejected moscows proposal to prolong start with no additional conditions as as an offer for extension and has not reached an agreement on its extension biden argues that the pact is beneficial to security and should be extended while agreement is sought while bidens positions on putin and russias actions suggest that tensions between washington and moscow remain tense and could potentially worsen once he takes office arms_control is of handful of issues that analysts could present platform for productive negotiations between the united_states and the kremlin biden has that he would have the united_states rejoin the nuclear agreement with iran which curbed the country nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief if tehran moves into compliance with its terms iran violated the terms of the agreement with global powers after trump withdrew the united_states the deal known as the jcpoa in and imposed sanctions on tehran the sanctions have hurt irans economy but not promoted it to seek deal biden has he would work with the other powers involved britain france germany and china as as the eu to amend aspects of the agreement once iran is in compliance with our allies we work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal provisions while also addressing other issues of concern such as human_rights violations and the jailing of foreigners biden biden he would bring troops home afghanistan almost years after the united_states led an invasion to drive the taliban extremist group power following the september attacks in and leave in place only small contingent of special forces who would carry out missions biden opposed the large buildup of troops in afghanistan while serving as vice_president to barring substantial developments before his inauguration on january he inherit historic but fragile peace process that the trump administration set in motion by reaching political deal with the taliban in february that paved the road for peace talks between the militants and the backed afghan government biden has he work with allies to strengthen democracies the world and push on creeping he has expressed concern over what is widely seen as rollback of democracy in some nato member states poland and hungary during my in office the united_states organize and host global summit for democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the free world it bring together the world democracies to strengthen our democratic

the election was major fraud on our nation using the twitter hashtag stopthesteal prominent republicans such as american conservative union chairman matt schlapp and eric trump the president son have

about the group had promoted debunked allegations of fraud claims that trump votes had been discarded bret shafer who tracks disinformation at the alliance for securing democracy he noticed that the group had been setting up private web sites as if anticipating such move propaganda organs have reported extensively on claims of fraud but have not gone out of their way to amplify them he what we ve seen for the most out of right is that the is mess it in chaos democracy is falling apart shafer on sept the fbi and the department of homeland_security issued public warning about the potential for

information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information trusted sources such as state and local election officials but shafer compared to what we are seeing in the domestic sphere the foreign stuff has been pretty tame ken dilanian is correspondent covering intelligence and national_security for the nbc investigative unit nbc universal moscow reported record numbers of infections and deaths the novel coronavirus on thursday the latest sign that the country is again struggling to contain an outbreak that kremlin officials only recently portrayed as largely under control the state coronavirus task force recorded infections and deaths on thursday alone raising the national tally to more than million cases and fatalities the global contagion currently is fourth in the for coronavirus infections behind brazil india and the united_states but despite what kremlin spokesman described as maximum pressure on the nation health_care system president_vladimir putin on thursday assured russians there would be no repeat of spring lockdown that hobbled the economy and sent his approval ratings tumbling we not planning to introduce total restrictive measures and order so called national lockdown where the economy and business essentially stop completely putin speaking by video to an annual investment forum putin decision to designate an extended non working holiday in april was generally credited by health officials with helping contain the virus but widely panned by citizens for failing to provide enough economic support to families and businesses the leader maintains that the health of citizens remains the government main priority in moscow largest city and the center of the country outbreak mayor sergei sobyanin has introduced limited measures aimed at containing second wave of infections as of this month masks and gloves are again mandatory on public transport the city introduced required distance learning for high school students businesses too are required to have third of their employees working remotely in comments on local television thursday sobyanin argued those measures were beginning to pay off this week we seeing figures that are lower than those the week before that tells us that there no more sharp escalation in moscow it stabilizing sobyanin but while moscow has vast financial resources the situation in what russians call the regions the rest of the country appears infinitely more dire on wednesday the kremlin point person on the coronavirus response deputy_prime minister tatiana golikova that hospital bed capacity was at in regions suggesting already underfunded health_care systems were at the breaking point the announcement came as ministry of health issued directive forbidding medical professionals to speak with the media about coronavirus related issues ministry officials the move was intended to heighten effectiveness in informing the public on preventing the spread yet the newly introduced rule immediately raised concern that has dogged the kremlin response the very outset of the pandemic what if the government was simply trying to hide the scale of the problem the mandate followed wave of grim coronavirus related stories to emerge various swaths of the country in recent days in barnaul the city local coronavirus infection ward earlier this month showed what appeared to be dozens of bodies in plastic bags cast about the hospital basement corridor local media later reported the overflow was due to relatives inability to collect the deceased for burial because pathology reports had yet to be issued morgues were already full the city administration later described the scene as temporary storage solution in omsk ambulance workers delivered covid patients directly to the steps of the local health ministry explaining that despite hours of searching local hospitals they had been unable to find single facility with available space to accept the patients covid is the disease caused by the coronavirus in the kurgan region in the ural mountains the defense ministry sent rapid force group of army medics to aid in the virus response after doctors made public plea to putin citing shortage of hospital space and staff and overloaded ambulances in rostov on don in south doctors reported deaths in local hospital because of lack of oxygen tanks for ventilators the patients died pleading for oxygen according to physicians on the scene in ufa where health_care workers and activists had accused officials of downplaying infections during an outbreak earlier this authorities acknowledged the city mayor died this week after monthlong bout with the coronavirus kremlin officials have argued individual horror stories fail to tell the larger success of the government coronavirus response putin has also endorsed the rollout of sputnik produced vaccine against the coronavirus that the kremlin be available beginning in december global health experts however caution the kremlin has embraced the vaccine before it passes standard stage trials for efficacy larger group testing of the drug is under way in moscow whether the vaccine proves effective

commission on orders the kremlin the stakes in how russians interpret the american electoral process this are high and mr putin allies it pro democracy activists in and the world have worried that turmoil in the west and mr trump undermining of american institutions could discredit liberal ideals in their countries all this stuff the criticism by trump de facto functions to justify aleksandr kynev political scientist it all finds very fertile ground in because we have mass distrust in our own elections is democracy on paper but mr putin largely eliminated democratic freedoms early in his rule the country still holds elections with the opposition candidates generally handpicked by the authorities to provide facade of choice only in do they win but russians are interested in how democracy can work and how political battle really looks mr volkov explaining why he undertook his marathon youtube broadcast for us he by way of contrast it huge triumph when we manage to register

of the state run rt television network wednesday night that the american election was neither free nor fair vladimir solovyov prominent talk show host the united_states had managed to deliver crushing blow against what trust remained in the procedure of elections itself mr trump contentions of voter fraud allowed the kremlin allies who are used to hearing allegations of rigged elections pro western opponents to basically turn the tables on state television anchors and analysts commenting on the american election deployed the same terms the opposition routinely uses to describe falsified elections at home there was talk of vbrosy or ballot stuffing and the of administrative resources the common practice by rulers across the post_soviet space to the tools of government to win elections and hobble opponents if biden is declared the winner trump have every reason and ability his notorious administrative resources to dunk the democrats in the mud in the most unbelievable way pro kremlin pundit aleksei mukhin on the rossiya state_controlled channel on thursday the pattern of the vote count in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania with mr trump taking the early lead followed by mr biden rapid gains absentee ballots led mr putin allies to echo the accusations of vote stuffing that the opposition often makes in and in belarus mr trump questioning of the integrity of the vote count ruling party lawmaker named oleg morozov thundered on state tv talk show thursday evoked the recent upheaval in another post_soviet country we seeing the kyrgyzization of the american electoral system mr morozov the main pillar on which america has always relied has been put in question the kremlin for some kind of clarity in the election results before commenting but the foreign ministry leapt at the opportunity to criticize the united_states with the same kind of language that some russians believe washington has and wrongly lectured them with with the opponents for the post of president running approximately equal to each_other the obvious faults of the american electoral system become clear the foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova this is partially explained by the archaic legal code and its ambiguity on key matters as we have more than once but the images on television of poll workers across america diligently counting ballots have told their own story about how democracy functions critics of the kremlin have next to no ability to the television airwaves so some tried to deploy social_media to push on the narrative of election fraud in america vladimir milov an adviser to mr navalny on facebook that the count of american mail in ballots could be trusted unlike in where remote voting is especially prone to falsification this isn where they hide ballots in safe at night that the election committee chairman has key to mr milov wrote mr putin for his won the right to run for more six terms in constitutional referendum this summer that was to

portugal but his madeira is magical his cellar is his shrine where an icon of jesus sits next to the thermometer and where he and his wife never set foot when they are in bad mood but the oak barrels

upstart vintners to an end covers almost seven million square miles of territory most of it frozen round and of the soil yielding little except cloudberries lingonberries and poking out of the thawing ground but then there is sliver the caucasus foothills to crimea where the softly undulating deep green land glowing beneath the warm autumn sun is reminiscent of tuscan afternoon the ancient greeks made wine here and so did the czars who brought in french expertise the soviets collectivized the vineyards and turned winemaking into industrial scale enterprises like that chateau of the proletariat in wine rich areas like the resort city of anapa there were once dispensing chilled riesling by the cupful at home in their basements people finessed their own small batch techniques nowadays the

greshnov former moscow banker pointed to his bottles there were no excise stamps typically required for alcohol sold in getting licensed for making and selling wine had been too costly for small scale producers like mr greshnov so he and dozens of others operated outside the law with wink and nod local officials who saw them as of the region identity and also drank their wines but in the last years

law_enforcement officials they are combating tax avoidance and counterfeit and unsanitary production which are indeed problems in recent changes in the law are supposed to it easier for small wineries to be legal but mr minasov calculates that wineries still to produce at_least bottles just to cover the expense at minimum of getting licensed and more problematically of keeping up with the reams of

russians to influence our election in mainly involving misinformation with the primary goal of denigrating joe_biden and the us indictment of six military intelligence hackers last_week served as reminder of the potential threat however as biden enters the final days of the campaign with significant lead putin appears to be hedging his bets the president pointedly declined to amplify donald_trump about biden son hunter and his past business dealings in ukraine noting he did not see anything criminal in them putin has also pointed to possible common ground with the democrats on social democratic ideology and arms_control the leader and the former vice_president certainly each_other past encounters though the relationship lacks any of the warmth that trump claims infuses his bond with the leader looking into your eyes and don you have soul biden told putin at meeting according to an account he he looked at me and he smiled and he we understand another biden has not dwelled on the worn topics of trump soft spot for putin or kremlin meddling in because coronavirus has cast such shadow over the election and the biden team feel that voters are tired of hearing about the most resonant issues for american voters right are trump mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic the economy and the dangers of white nationalism by contrast election interference in seems more distant for those just trying to ends meet michael carpenter foreign_policy adviser during biden as vice_president who remains in touch with the campaign it is possible too that russiagate was never major vote winning issue trump supporters dismissed the charges as fake and of his opponents were more focused on other issues is media and washington conversation my students don care about they care about black lives matter and metoo nina khrushcheva american professor of international affairs at the school in york questions over the business dealings of biden son in ukraine have failed to resonate beyond trump core base with of biden alleged wrongdoing in ukraine largely falling flat if moscow did indeed their man has done little to improve the the bilateral relationship over the past four_years despite his personal praise for putin but and naked america self interest is something that the kremlin appreciates and explain why officials in moscow want to see trump win second term putin and people him might like trump because he fits very nicely with their view of the world he graphic illustration of their logic that the world is moving away liberal values and multilateralism and towards sovereignty and traditional values andrey kortunov of the international affairs council he that while putin genuinely does not understand politicians such as angela merkel or emmanuel macron and believes their talk of values to be hollow and cynical with trump there is recognition of kindred spirit if there is little affection for him as person the men share scepticism of international bodies emphasis on sovereignty approach to foreign_policy and feeling that discussions about values are mere hypocrisy kortunov putin earlier this month noted biden history of sharp anti rhetoric and contrasted it with trump oft stated desire for better ties with moscow biden approach to would involve supporting dialogue on arms_control strategic stability crisis management and risk reduction position of strength carpenter saying it was simplistic to see the question of policy as black and white hawk or dove calculation kortunov that unlike germany israel or china is in the privileged position that the outcome of the election is likely to have little effect on bilateral_relations but the bad is that this is because it be bad either way almost anything that could be broken is already broken he and there is little prospect of improvement kirill dmitriev the head of sovereign wealth fund who was for informal contacts with members of the trump entourage after his victory declined to whether he favoured trump or biden victory but he either way it was hard to imagine how things could get worse we are at the lowest point ever in the history of us relations so going lower would be difficult he still denies all accusations of meddling in the election whether it be the hacking of democratic party servers or armies of internet trolls stirring up trouble on facebook and twitter but who was the national_security council director for european and affairs for three years of the trump administration and testified at trump impeachment hearing hawkish security

materials making our own mistakes she the interference wouldn have resonated our deep polarisation and our structural issues this round there are allegations of attempts to influence the political

there was no evidence that any votes were changed or that any voting machines were manipulated state election officials were not sufficiently warned or prepared to handle an attack hostile nation state actor the department of homeland_security and the fbi alerted states to the threat of cyberattacks in the late summer and fall of but the warnings did not provide enough information or go to the right people in the states who administer our election cybersecurity for electoral infrastructure at the state and local level was sorely lacking in although state election officials disagree with that assessment for example aging voting equipment particularly electronic voting machines that had no paper record of votes were alleged to be vulnerable to exploitation by committed adversary despite the focus on this issue since some of these vulnerabilities remain dhs has focused its efforts to build trust with states and deploy resources to assist in securing elections again however with limited results according to some state election officials what has changed since the election in january then homeland_security secretary jeh johnson election infrastructure to be critical infrastructure that meant dhs could prioritize its cybersecurity assistance to state and local election officials who request it the designation also made it easier for the federal government to have full and frank discussions with key stakeholders regarding sensitive vulnerability information the department of homeland_security cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency which is responsible for has been closely with state and local election officials in all states to secure their election systems the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency provides actionable information and intelligence to election officials and technical assistance to secure systems and supports election focused incident response planning training and exercises that cooperation among federal state and local officials has paid off state and local election officials are taking the threat of hacking seriously and have been reporting suspicious activity more often to the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency an agency official it not an actual increase in activity it an increase in awareness and information sharing across all partners over the past four_years state election officials were better informed about what cybersecurity issues to look for what to protect against and how to mitigate cyber related issues we can also thank the cyber_command for taking actions against adversaries the past several weeks to prevent interference in our elections for example had been sending intimidating emails to american voters in october gen paul nakasone the director of the national_security agency and cyber_command leader also credits the strong coordination among agencies social_media companies private sector firms academia the national guard and foreign partners for working to secure elections against foreign interference facebook and twitter have foreign accounts targeting elections for example although they have been justifiably for censoring americans using their platforms to discuss candidates and election issues on wednesday cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency director christopher krebs officials had no evidence any foreign adversary was

station at kazansky railway at the of the referendum the inevitable speculation was that putin might intend actually to remain president until for example referred to his bid to stay in power until the middle of the next decade in fact hes probably just giving himself options and staying in the kremlin until is just of them after all putin would be years old by then legislation submitted to the parliament this week offers clue to another option putin might be considering as november ex presidents immunity criminal prosecution could be extended to any offences committed in their lifetimes the

united_states proposing to extend it at_least for putins statement comes amid conflicting signals and diplomats about the fate of the that is set to expire in february unless moscow and washington agree on its extension speaking at meeting of his security council putin that it would be extremely sad if the treaty ceases to exist being replaced by another fundamental document of the kind all those years the start has worked playing its fundamental role of limiting and containing an arms race he noted the start treaty was signed in by and president dmitry medvedev the pact limits each country to no more than deployed nuclear warheads and deployed missiles and bombers and envisages sweeping on site inspections to verify compliance after both moscow and washington withdrew the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty last start is the only nuclear arms_control deal between the countries still standing previously offered its extension for five years any conditions while the administration pushed for arms_control agreement that would also include china moscow has described that idea as unfeasible pointing at beijing refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its smaller nuclear arsenal putin on friday proposed to extend the existing treaty any conditions for at_least to allow for substantive talks instructing foreign minister sergey lavrov to get quick answer to the offer he emphasized that is ready to discuss the weapons it deployed in future arms talks with the united_states earlier this week lavrov voiced skepticism about reaching deal on start noting that can accept the conditions put forward by the united_states for its extension lavrov specified that can agree to the proposal to limit battlefield nuclear weapons alongside nuclear warheads that arm strategic missiles and bombers until the agrees to withdraw its tactical nuclear weapons europe he also noted that moscow wouldn accept the demand to have intrusive verification measures like those that existed in the when inspectors were positioned at missile factories lavrov pessimistic view contrasted with statements diplomats who that moscow and washington were close to deal we would

administration officials that iran has been actively interfering in the presidential_election intelligence officials they remained far more concerned about which in recent days has hacked into state and local computer_networks in breaches that could allow moscow broader access to american voting infrastructure the discovery of the hacks came as american intelligence_agencies infiltrating networks themselves have pieced together details of what they believe are plans to interfere in the presidential race in its final days or immediately after the election on nov officials did not clear what planned to do but they its operations would be intended to help president trump potentially by exacerbating disputes the results especially if the race is too close to call and homeland_security officials also on thursday that state hackers had targeted dozens of state and local governments and aviation networks starting in september they stole the computer servers of at_least unidentified targets and continued to crawl through some of the affected networks the agencies other officials that the targets included some voting related systems and that they have been collateral damage in the attacks so far there is no evidence that the russians have changed any vote_tallies or voter_registration information officials they added that the backed hackers had penetrated the computer_networks taking further action as they did in but american officials expect that if the presidential race is not called on election night groups could their knowledge of the local computer systems to deface websites release nonpublic information or similar steps that could sow chaos and doubts about the integrity of the results according to officials briefed on the intelligence such steps could fuel mr trump unsubstantiated claims that the vote is rigged and that he can be defeated only if his opponents cheat some intelligence officials view intentions as more significant than the on wednesday night by the director of national intelligence john ratcliffe that iran has been involved in the spread of faked threatening emails which were made to appear as if they came the proud_boys right_wing extremist group the treasury department on thursday against iraj masjedi former general in iran revolutionary guard corps and the country ambassador to iraq the department general masjedi had overseen training of pro iranian militia groups in iraq and directed groups responsible for killing american forces there officials briefed on the intelligence that mr ratcliffe had accurately summarized the preliminary conclusion about iran but tehran hackers have accomplished that mission simply by assembling public information and then routing the threatening emails through estonia saudi arabia and other countries to hide their tracks official compared the iranian action to playing single baseball while the russians are major leaguers nonetheless the iranian and the activity could pave the way for so called perception hacks which are intended to leave the impression that foreign powers have greater access to the voting system than they really do federal officials have warned for months that small breaches could be exaggerated to prompt inaccurate charges of widespread voter fraud officials ability to change vote_tallies nationwide would be difficult given how disparate american elections are the graver concern is the potential effect of any attack on few key precincts in battleground states hackers recently obtained access in couple limited cases to election jurisdiction an election related network christopher krebs the director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency on thursday but he was careful to note that the breaches had nothing to do with the casting and counting of votes the hackers believed to be operating at the behest of federal security service the the successor agency to the soviet_era infiltrated dozens of state and local computer_networks in recent weeks according to officials and researchers but mr krebs the attacks appeared to be opportunistic in nature scattershot break in of vulnerable systems rather_than an attempt to zero in on key battleground states but officials were alarmed by the combination of the targets the timing the attacks began less than months ago and the adversary which is known for burrowing inside the supply chain of critical infrastructure that want to down in the future the officials fear that could change delete or freeze voter_registration or pollbook making it harder for voters to cast ballots invalidating mail in ballots or creating enough uncertainty to undermine results it reasonable to assume any attempt at the election systems could be for the same purpose john hultquist the director of threat analysis at fireeye security firm that has been tracking the group foray into state and local systems this could be the reconnaissance for disruptive activity mr krebs so far was not as active as iran and its targeting was imprecise they broadly looking to scan for vulnerabilities and they working he current and former officials there was little doubt that remained greater threat and questioned why the focus was on iran on wednesday night though they acknowledged that tehran interference was real and troubling administration officials the conference reflected the urgency of the intelligence about iran but some saw politics at play mr ratcliffe focus on iran would potentially benefit mr trump politically it is concerning to me that the administration is willing to talk about what the iranians are doing supposedly to hurt trump than what the russians are likely doing to help him jeh johnson former secretary of homeland_security in the obama administration if the russians have in fact breached voter_registration then the american people deserve to their government what it believes the russians are doing with that senior official briefed on the intelligence american spy agencies had been tracking the iranian group responsible for the spoofed emails for some as result the government was able to quickly debunk the falsified proud_boys emails and identify iran as the culprit iran hackers appear to have scanned or penetrated some state and local networks government officials on thursday but security experts the proud_boys email campaign that the government attributed to iran did not appear to be based on hacked materials and instead relied on publicly available information that florida officials regularly distribute this was an email sent nonexistent domain using publicly available information kevin brien the chief executive of greathorn cybersecurity firm there was no hack here your name your party affiliation your address and email address are all generally speaking public information mr brien the information presented publicly that iran was culpable speaker nancy pelosi also voiced skepticism of mr ratcliffe announcement is the villain here she before briefing intelligence officials what we have seen in the public domain iran is bad actor but in no way equivalent so far the hackers have not focused on swing states where hack that affects digital could have maximum effect they have taken scattershot approach instead hitting systems in multiple states some battlegrounds experts they might be just testing to see where they could get in like thief trying every doorknob in the neighborhood my concern is not that they are pinpointing individual races but are gaining access where they can for some disruption down the road mr hultquist the threat is similar to the that officials have highlighted ransomware attacks which hold hostage until victims pay to have access restored likewise officials and researchers believe the attacks would not necessarily change vote_tallies but could voter inaccessible or delete or change voters registration to disenfranchise voters or cause the kind of confusion and delays that would undermine american confidence in the election in recent years homeland_security officials have made concerted effort to secure voter_registration systems and to ensure that election officials have paper copies of voter information in case of disruptions but they have further to go in gainesville ga this week ransomware attack held city systems hostage an online map with polling locations and the database used to verify voters signatures on mail in ballots officials and experts believe the greatest defense against coordinated cyberattack on the election is not so how secure these voting system are but how disparate you can just hit the election eric chien cybersecurity director at symantec of broadcom which was among the to detail the stuxnet attacks by the united_states and israel on iran nuclear program decade ago the soft targets are really the state and local election committees local websites that provide information about polling places and hold voter_registration alan

federation official chechnya since shortly after the soviet_union collapse aims and policies in the south_caucasus have been constant but its capabilities to project power and influence have fluctuated engagement with the entire caucasus region is best characterized as tide its power and influence began to ebb at the start of the karabakh_conflict with the february massacre of armenians in the azerbaijani city of sumqayit being the key galvanizing event after that the tide receded rapidly leaving possessions in the north caucasus effective central control the chechen war marked low tide which only began to rise with the second chechen war beginning in until about was too weak and internally divided to project power and influence in the wider caucasus region in meaningful way to be sure influence was never gone completely during the lowest ebb of the tide still marshaled greater resources than the states of the caucasus could muster and it threw its weight but in the did not have unified governing apparatus but rather mass of competing clans among which regional actors could maneuver for example after the soviet_collapse moscow left the military units in the caucasus to their own devices those units served as mercenaries arms suppliers and logistics providers to both_sides in the karabakh_conflict it took decade for moscow to reassert its so called power vertical in the caucasus symbolized by president_vladimir putin success in in finally ousting chief of the general staff anatoliy kvashnin assertiveness in the region grew steadily thereafter with sharp upticks after the war with georgia and putin return to the presidency in but while moscow has gained the capacity to project more power and influence the regional landscape has changed the surge in fighting over nagornyy_karabakh that began in late september has demonstrated that is struggling to contend with vastly more complicated landscape more external actors are on the scene most notably turkey and all three south_caucasus states armenia azerbaijan and georgia have adapted their strategies to deal with the environment increased efforts have had decidedly mixed results three factors were evident when the soviet_union collapsed and continue today narrowing policy options in the region armenia azerbaijan and georgia are all radically different with varying attitudes toward and moscow rule throughout the imperial and soviet eras for centuries armenia has sought protection against turkey and iran which ruled most of the armenian historic homelands this security concern was paramount in the immediate aftermath of the soviet_collapse the soviet army had disappeared leaving the turkish third army as the most potent military force in the wider region for its post_soviet views armenia as its closest friend in the region large and influential armenian diaspora in has maintained those positive feelings azerbaijani elites russified by the oil boom of the late nineteenth century have largely been friendly to thanks to former president heydar aliyev who rose through the ranks of the soviet kgb and neither feared nor hated the post_soviet rulers of generally positive attitude toward survived the nationalisms of the years immediately following the soviet_collapse though post_soviet was initially suspicious of the expansion of turkish and western influence in azerbaijan has since forged close energy relations with turkey in the early period these commercial relations took precedence in the turkey relationship more recently as detailed later in the paper the increasing ambiguity of turkish relations has complicated relations with azerbaijan armenia and azerbaijan have incorporated friendly relations with into wider strategy former armenian foreign minister vartan oskanian described it as multivectoral approach in which foreign_policy vectors point in different directions it entails seeking close relations with and assistance powers other than primarily the united_states and the european union eu large armenian diasporas in the united_states and france have aided this endeavor in contrast poor record on democracy and human_rights as as the armenian diaspora efforts in the united_states have hobbled azerbaijan in the united_states congressional legislation blocked most assistance to azerbaijan until waiver authority was granted in in the wake of the september terrorist attacks and azerbaijan subsequent role in assisting antiterrorism efforts elsewhere in georgia nationalism remains centered on the rejection of since the massacre of unarmed civilians by soviet troops in the capital tbilisi in and the post independence presidency of former soviet dissident and extreme nationalist zviad gamsakhurdia georgian society has generally come to view as usurping occupier february the the red army invaded tbilisi in is still observed annually as soviet occupation georgians explain away decades of fawning over the occupiers as ambassador did for all those years that the russians ruled us we told them we loved them and they actually believed us georgian warlords deposed gamsakhurdia in january and installed former soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze as weak figurehead his tenure as president involved constant renegotiation of his powers to gain ascendancy over those warlords in the early still at his weakest vis vis the warlords and pressured by support for abkhaz and ossetian separatism he tried to harness not reverse the extreme nationalism of his predecessor supporters especially those displaced abkhazia by backed separatists for their russians have acted as emotionally as the georgians seeing georgia aspirations toward the north atlantic treaty organization nato and the eu as the betrayal of its once advantageous position within moscow empire during regularly occurring period of heightened tensions normally calm senior diplomat asked when the soviet_union was ruled by people named jughashvili orjonikidze and beria just who was occupying whom after the september attacks as troops were arriving in georgia to train georgians in an embittered general recalling the old times of officers warm reception in georgia over countless song and wine filled banquets the americans they teach the georgians to fight in reality the georgians teach the americans to sing cannot deal with armenia azerbaijan and georgia in isolation because the countries own relations with another are dense and fraught with tension and conflict most salient is the karabakh_conflict over which armenians and azerbaijanis have shed so blood since both_sides appeal to for support and view amity toward the other side as betrayal in the early years tried to profit the conflict clandestinely providing weaponry and mercenaries to both_sides in and russians backed coups to install puppets in azerbaijan but both backfired in former azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov attempt to return moscow was thwarted by the nationalist azerbaijan popular front and in surat huseynov revolt against the popular front was hijacked by aliyev who took power for himself alone thereafter stepped in the region since brokering ceasefire in the karabakh_conflict in moscow has limited its interventions to trying unsuccessfully to get the sides to agree to led peacekeeping force of the sort moscow installed to control the abkhazia south_ossetia and transdniestria separatist conflicts remains supplier of weaponry to both_sides and every major arms sale to provokes protests the other because azerbaijan oil revenues expanded it has been able to diversify its defense procurements but armenia remains dependent on for arms and security guarantees georgia is closely intertwined with both armenia and azerbaijan there are large armenian and azerbaijani minorities in georgia in separatist abkhazia armenians actually outnumber the abkhaz despite initial nationalist difficulties in borchaly an azerbaijani inhabited section of georgia georgian azerbaijani relations have been good almost since georgia independence largely thanks to reconciliation of convenience between soviet_era rivals eduard shevardnadze and heydar aliyev aliyev needed georgia to enable the western transit of azerbaijan hydrocarbon exports and the import of western goods turkey shevardnadze needed azerbaijan to secure oil and gas pipelines to provide both transit royalties and strategic importance to the west he also needed aliyev to help ensure that the large azerbaijani population of georgia reliably voted for shevardnadze political grouping the citizens union georgian armenian relations have been trickier portion of the armenian population in georgia is concentrated in javakheti near large soviet later military base that fueled the region economy until it was closed in to the javakhk armenians sought independence apparently with encouragement but armenia only transit routes to and the west lay through georgia as the karabakh_conflict had closed armenia borders with turkey and azerbaijan so the government of then armenian president levon ter petrosyan tamped down javakhk separatism relations between the countries grew closer after mikheil saakashvili came to the presidency in georgia in and they have remained friendly under subsequent leaders to this policy in the south_caucasus is intertwined with the north caucasus to which has devoted the blood and treasure of generations and which post_soviet sees as key to the integrity of the state domestic security concerns have intruded on the south_caucasus in number of areas as power ebbed away at the end of the soviet_era the army for the in centuries no_longer wielded the decisive force in the region the turkish third army was the most powerful military in the region and locals adapted to the strategic effects threw its diminished resources into the caucasus to suppress the chechen rebellion and met defeat subsequent of the region and its demands to adapt the conventional armed forces in europe treaty to allow for greater freedom of movement in the flank stemmed its perceived to redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence in the region to address moves to adapt the treaty azerbaijan and georgia allied with moldova and ukraine to form what later solidified into the organization for democracy and economic development known simply as the guam ossetians ethno linguistically and religiously different their neighbors have been principal allies in the north caucasus for centuries as dealt with host of ethnic nationalisms in the years after the soviet_collapse chechen separatism and later an armed islamist movement north ossetia gained strategic importance to and leverage with leadership it has used that leverage to ensure robust support for south ossetian separatism georgia likewise other ethnic groups in the mountains of the north caucasus for example the chechens kabardians and cherkes saw in abkhaz separatism georgia the validation of their own ethnic nationalisms with facilitation so called volunteers made their way to abkhazia to join the separatist war against georgia to among the most effective of these was the chechen shamil basayev who was later an archnemesis of the russians but their ally in that struggle during the second chechen war fighters and their families took refuge in georgia pankisi gorge which was effectively outside the georgian government control president boris yeltsin called shevardnadze in november to demand the reinstatement of border troops in georgia and passage for military units through georgia to attack pankisi the south shevardnadze stalled and then called on the americans to dissuade yeltsin later after the september terrorist attacks the united_states sent troops to train the georgians to restore security in pankisi forestalling actions there worse the point of view shevardnadze made deal with ruslan gelayev chechen commander sheltering in the pankisi gorge to launch an attack on abkhaz held territory in the attack failed but the authorities viewed this series of events as proof that georgia was treacherous and untrustworthy lastly azerbaijan shares border and considerable ethnic overlap with dagestan autonomous republic where salafist proselytizing made extensive inroads in the after some years full fledged islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked up with the remains of the armed chechen nationalist movement which also fell under salafist influence when attacks began on authorities in dagestan security cooperation with azerbaijan gained importance for internal security the stage was thus set early on for consistent static policy toward the south_caucasus an economy of force balancing act to preserve traditional friendship and strategic alliance with armenia harming economic and security relationship with azerbaijan and constant emotional and ever deepening hostility toward georgia views the international arena as series of camps each centered by power whose greatness is confirmed by possessing camp has been keen to ensure that the nations forged out of former soviet republics remain in its camp and has formed multinational institutions to cement those relations initially had hopes that the commonwealth of independent states cis formed when the soviet_union broke up might fill the bill azerbaijan and armenia joined the cis at its inception in but it was not until that georgia president shevardnadze under military pressure in support of abkhaz separatism and facing rebellion by ousted former president gamsakhurdia reluctantly acceded in georgia withdrew the cis after the country defeat in the russo georgian war with the cis having little influence put forward other institutions to accomplish the task the collective security treaty originally signed in became the collective security treaty organization csto in designed as counterweight to nato armenia joined to relieve its security concerns with regard to turkey azerbaijan and georgia did not the eurasian customs union officially formed in but active onward also included armenia but not azerbaijan or georgia in turned the customs union into the eurasian economic union eaeu intended as mirror image of the eu moscow ongoing attempts to equate the organizations on the international stage has had significant effects on the caucasus as noted later in this paper azerbaijan was able to avoid joining so called camp thanks to its independent oil revenues which have grown for both azerbaijan and other post_soviet caspian littoral states in the early moscow ability to project power was low and could only protest ineffectually when littoral countries signed hydrocarbon extraction contracts in the absence of an international agreement to define national rights in the caspian azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan brought in western energy majors fearing reaction azerbaijan signed its major contract in the status of the caspian was not codified preliminarily until and to this no treaty covers exploitation of the seabed could not fight em so it joined em settling for sharing in the profits hydrocarbon development and transit for in the mid the united_states and maneuvered against another through their respective support of pipelines the united_states heavily promoted the baku tbilisi ceyhan btc pipeline as an alternative to monopoly on hydrocarbon transit to the west however doctrine demanded that the pipeline be commercially viable in its own right and the united_states refused to put resources into boosting that viability recognizing this banked on the oil majors desire to save money by transporting the oil by tanker across the black sea and through the turkish straits but when then bp chair john browne visited istanbul and inspected the narrow bosphorus passage he decided the route was too risky and threw the weight of the oil majors behind btc closest relationship in the south_caucasus remains with armenia the country most firmly entrenched in camp it is frequently called strategic alliance and for armenia this is certainly the case as troops based in its second largest city gyumri form trip wire against turkish military action while azerbaijan generally deals with other countries transactionally another criterion takes precedence their stance on armenia and the karabakh_conflict this is the trickiest situation for to manage azerbaijan is largest trading partner in the caucasus the countries have important common issues regarding hydrocarbons and sees strategic aim in keeping azerbaijan out of what it calls the western camp therefore while supporting armenia has tried to avoid alienating azerbaijan during the recent surge in fighting until was discreet about its arms sales to armenia to avoid provoking azerbaijan denying reports of large arms transfers when they surfaced in more recently has started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry to both_sides and has been more open about its balancing for example in signed lease on its military base in gyumri extending it to and agreed to sell surface to air missiles to azerbaijan as of this balancing is involved in attempts to mediate between azerbaijan and armenia to resolve the karabakh_conflict since has been co chair of the minsk group body under the aegis of the organization for security and co operation in europe osce and composed of number of countries interested in brokering peace in the united_states and france joined as co chairs and the three countries have conducted all negotiations thereafter significant input the other group members this structure has facilitated west cooperation to keep politically insoluble problem flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline states when dmitry medvedev was president of he poured great efforts into peace initiatives and with french and assent came to dominate the process as of this campaign medvedev also supported the opening between armenia and turkey azerbaijan closest ally that rapprochement failed however due to opposition key constituencies on both_sides ultimately azerbaijan and armenia were not interested in negotiated solution and medvedev initiative foundered relations with georgia quickly went into downward spiral after the soviet_collapse used substantial military force to ensure the survival and then victory of the separatist rebellion in abkhazia and leveraged that and revolt by gamsakhurdia to force shevardnadze to accept peacekeeping force in western georgia still hostile backed attempts in and to assassinate shevardnadze until the latter attempt shevardnadze had been trying to play and the united_states off against each_other but these actions drove shevardnadze squarely into the arms of the united_states the russians loathed shevardnadze for his role in the collapse of the soviet bloc on television program he was reviled as the ostap bender of the soviet_union after the con man protagonist of the classic soviet comic novel but that feeling paled beside the emotions stoked in the leadership by the flamboyant and mercurial mikheil saakashvili who ousted shevardnadze at the end of and became president in in that saakashvili also ousted the quasi independent aslan abashidze his rule over the autonomous batumi region which housed military base also in tensions flared in south_ossetia retaliated over the next few years banning the import of georgian products banning flights between and georgia closing the land border between the countries and launching an aggressive campaign against ethnic georgians in citizens their businesses and their families in closed off most of north ossetia to foreigners allowing preparations for war to proceed unseen by the outside world and in as tensions flared again in south_ossetia troops invaded defeating georgia forces in short order occupying parts of georgia outside abkhazia and south_ossetia and incorporating these conquests into the separatist statelets which shortly thererafter recognized as independent but the war also brought the expansion of competitor presence the small neutral osce mission was scrapped and large eu monitoring mission was put in its place despite the limitations placed on that mission the overall eu presence and commitment sharply increased putin return to the presidency in came with more assertive foreign_policy leaders wholly dependent on were installed in the separatist entities supported south_ossetia and abkhazia replacing established leaders who were pro but possessed their own independent power bases more importantly began to treat the european union not just nato as strategic rival intent on taking over parts of what medvedev had called sphere of five years earlier that view had been restricted to the or senior officers of the hard power ministries primarily the military internal affairs and security services after putin return to the presidency it became official policy the ukrainian crisis of began with putin pressuring both ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and armenian president serzh sargsyan into repudiating the eu association agreements they had signed and instead joining the nascent centric eaeu the pressure on sargsyan included putin visit to azerbaijan capital baku to discuss arms sales yanukovych caving to putin pressure triggered the revolution of dignity in ukraine and his eventual downfall sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequences he explained to the nation that security concerns necessitated joining the led organization that only could safeguard armenia its neighbors however after rejecting the eu sargsyan immediately tried to placate it negotiations eventually restarted on trade agreement and in armenia signed comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with the eu after few protests armenians fell in line with sargsyan capitulation to putin wishes they assumed their security expectations would be met and that this change was worth the economic disadvantages of giving up the association with the eu indeed when few months later occupied crimea and annexed it after the fig leaf of controlled referendum armenians saw this as model and justification for future annexation of nagornyy_karabakh and the surrounding territories actions had called into question all territorial dispositions after the soviet_collapse which had been agreed among the union republics codified in the cis treaty and endorsed by the international community with borders questioned and more capable of projecting power it was better to be close ally of than potential victim but in april armenians suffered rude awakening on april azerbaijan began military operation along the line of contact in karabakh and over the next four days managed to regain few strategic points occupied by the karabakh armenians years before reaction was to maintain its balancing act foreign minister sergey lavrov went to the region explicitly to be neutral mediator he brought ceasefire plan and proposed the peacekeeping force that had been rejected so years earlier that approach did not go over with the armenian populace in their view armenia was treaty ally of and had given up european aspirations to stay in camp and therefore should be on armenia side however as far as was concerned legally the combat had nothing to do with armenia but was between nagornyy_karabakh and azerbaijan the armenian people did not see it that way after being convinced by their leaders over generation that karabakh and armenia had become single polity sargsyan who initially supported the idea of peacekeeping force was seen as having sold out armenian interests he then had to backtrack putting fatal cracks in his prestige and authority almost immediately mutinies and demonstrations broke out occasionally with subtle anti flavor in july group of gunmen calling themselves sasna tsrer daredevils of sassoun an armenian epic poem violently took over police station and held out against government forces for weeks demanding sargsyan resignation after they surrendered they retained widespread support which translated into people fed up with the ruling elite and with other factors such as notorious murder by soldier price hikes by the owned electricity supplier and continued arms sales to azerbaijan further exacerbated popular discontent in faced with term limits when his presidency was to expire in sargsyan chose of the standard post_soviet autocratic solutions to staying in power establishing parliamentary system turning the presidency into figurehead and becoming prime_minister sargsyan and his dashnak nationalist allies duly won parliamentary elections in and figurehead president was in due course elected in then the play went off script the aggrieved populace rose up in demonstrations and in just over month sargsyan was ousted opposition_leader nikol pashinyan was installed as acting prime_minister and elections affirmed his position later in the so far this scenario resembles of the color revolutions that putin had railed against for the previous fifteen years and had tried to reverse through military force in georgia syria and ukraine but instead of condemning pashinyan who had sharply criticized during the demonstrations and lending full support to sargsyan of putin most loyal supporters putin was remarkably restrained throughout and had friendly and supportive meeting with pashinyan just days after the latter took power publicly offering him his congratulations and best wishes it is possible that blamed sargsyan for the anti sentiment following the clashes of april but it is also clear that pashinyan made efforts to reassure putin as he like the entire armenian electorate understood that remained the guarantor of armenia security vis vis its larger neighbors he also understood that any rift with would create vulnerability that azerbaijan could exploit with regard to karabakh pashinyan knew he could not afford any daylight between armenia and he left armenia in the eaeu and csto he made clear that he would pursue democratic system but he also that he viewed democracy as firm belief rather_than geopolitical orientation making clear the distinction perhaps the fact that putin knew this as implying no major changes in armenia strategic orientation occasioned his restraint if there is no threat that armenia leave its camp can continue balancing its policy toward azerbaijan and armenia azerbaijan is the type of country with which putin seems to feel comfortable stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policies azerbaijan causes few headaches for and demands only that its transactional approach be reciprocated president ilham aliyev began his rule only three years after putin took over his father heydar aliyev had ruled azerbaijan for decade before that not counting the soviet period when he also ruled the country as his own fiefdom heydar aliyev in the senior most ranks of the soviet state communist_party and security services made his attitude very different other post_soviet rulers some of whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki in soviet times and saw moscow as the source of all power heydar aliyev treated post_soviet rulers the fealty or fear that some of his contemporaries showed ilham aliyev does not have the experience or ability of his father but he has inherited that legacy of autonomous sovereignty if pashinyan intends to show that democracy is belief not geopolitical choice the aliyevs have since shown that the same is true of autocracy azerbaijan and have enjoyed functional transactional relationship that is cordial neighborly and devoid of emotion to some extent azerbaijan grew ideologically closer to in the wake of the ukraine crisis as both countries saw themselves as attacked and undermined by fifth column of western supported civil_society and nongovernmental organizations in the chief of azerbaijan presidential apparatus usually considered closest to in the azerbaijani leadership published scathing article outlining that worldview he implied that charges of human_rights violations against country only proved that its leadership was defending its sovereignty but ideological sympathy never overcame azerbaijan transactional approach to relations with in azerbaijan demanded sharp increase in the rent was paying for the soviet_era qabala radar station the station was of the soviet and strategic early warning system and therefore the united_states favored its continued functioning to help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launches nonetheless azerbaijan stuck to its price demands and the russians eventually closed the station at the end of apart its transactional approach the azerbaijani leadership has single prism for judging the actions of all other countries the karabakh_conflict since independence azerbaijan has rejected virtually all forms of multilateral cooperation involving armenia that has imposed durable limit on the extent of rapprochement with for example azerbaijan has not joined the csto of which armenia is member to do so it would have to renounce any military solution to the karabakh_conflict and it has been tenet of faith in azerbaijan that only the credible threat of military solution can pressure armenia to negotiate seriously nor has azerbaijan joined the eaeu as armenia did joining it could limit azerbaijan ability to its economic leverage to marshal international support on karabakh and counter armenian diaspora influence in the west particularly in the united_states and france indeed because annexation of crimea calls into question the borders of the former soviet republics which the republics recognize as state borders under the alma ata declaration of december it also calls into question the basis for azerbaijani claims to sovereignty over nagornyy_karabakh moreover for the last fifteen years proposed principles for negotiated peace in the karabakh_conflict have included binding expression of the popular as of the ultimate disposition of the territory the staged referendum in crimea drove home to the azerbaijanis how easy it is for the power with boots on the ground to ensure its desired outcome in such vote all in all since azerbaijan has become if anything more transactional in its approach to the offensive in karabakh which might earlier have been deterred by reluctance to antagonize can be seen as example the fighting azerbaijan initiated on september can also be seen as transaction with made possible by turkish intervention to be sure aim of the offensive is to regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chips armenia side of the board but perhaps the larger aim is to threaten putin with instability and possibly region wide war if he does not force deep concessions on armenia aliyev ignored lavrov initial offer the return of provinces in exchange for being allowed to deploy peacekeeping force whatever the outcome it is clear that to azerbaijan is less of partner and more of problem to be solved azerbaijan tries to solve its problem through closer relations with in particular turkey and china turkey has been azerbaijan main advocate in the international sphere aside ethnic kinship significant azeri population lives in eastern turkey and deep historical links before the soviet takeover turkey is quick to cite certain protectorate rights granted under the treaties of moscow and kars since independence azerbaijan has seen turkey as counterweight to power at present however turkey has its own complex relations with turkey enjoys the positive effects of continued close energy and pipeline relations as as personal interactions between putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan but offsetting these effects are sharp differences between turkey and on the conflicts in syria and libya azerbaijan seeks to ensure that turkey support vis vis is unwavering turkey support of azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement in the autumn fighting have granted azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver vis vis both on the battlefield and with regard to mediation efforts it took the kremlin almost weeks to arrange putin aliyev phone call humanitarian truce brokered by lavrov fell apart almost immediately china has increased its engagement with the caucasus as of its belt and road initiative though neither its trade nor investment in the region compare with its far more massive engagement in central asia its main partner in the region is azerbaijan which has the largest population economy and reserves of natural resources the partnership makes sense geopolitically as although china is major trading partner for armenia and georgia armenia is too dependent on to be pried loose and china is probably wary of sensitivities on georgia china has become the third largest source of imports for azerbaijan after and turkey azerbaijan presents the most potential for future political rapprochement and china unlike the west is not burdened with concerns over azerbaijan human_rights record azerbaijan hopes that as the belt and road initiative progresses china increase its of azerbaijan for the transit of cargo to europe floating cargo across the caspian and loading it onto the railroad link opened in between baku and kars in turkey via georgia putin once famously declared that he would hang saakashvili by his testicles that promise remains unfulfilled but not for want of trying saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority in and was voted out of office in if putin thought saakashvili ouster by the billionaire and until shortly before then citizen bidzina ivanishvili and his georgian dream party would liberate wellspring of affection for he was in for disappointment the georgian populace remains deeply suspicious of in late nato initiated major assistance program the substantial nato georgia package sharply ramping up security cooperation with the georgian dream government hostile and aggressive policy toward georgia too remains unchanged as always the pressure point between and georgia has been separatism namely the backed polities in abkhazia and south_ossetia in the run up to putin return to the presidency serving local officials in areas controlled by especially in the supported south_ossetia and abkhazia and transdniestria outside the region were ousted with moscow backing newcomers who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience to putin alone at the end of edmund kokoity who had ruled south_ossetia since was forced to resign the leadership and was ultimately replaced by leonid tibilov veteran of the kgb in abkhazia the death of sergei bagapsh in triggered premature power struggle that threw the plans off track in the elections that followed moscow chosen candidate raul khajimba was defeated however with the intervention of putin fixer vladislav surkov president alexander ankvab was ousted in june and khajimba was installed by then had occupied and annexed crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprisings in donbass as as kharkiv and odessa in response the west had imposed sanctions perhaps this left putin and his regime less concerned with placating western opinion and he moved to annex the separatists in all but name as early as october the month after khajimba inauguration presented abkhazia with draft treaty of alliance integration and partnership whose main points were the takeover of key executive departments of the abkhaz state by their homologues with at best nominal abkhazian security institutions serving as fig leaf presented south_ossetia with draft comprising identical terms at about the same though the public announcement came in november in the treaties that were eventually signed the abkhaz won face saving concessions the russians it took four drafts before the south ossetians signed but their version was closer to the original the close informal relations between south_ossetia and north ossetia made the words on paper less important the stifling embrace of moscow and the suspected poisoning of khajimba electoral rival led to the ouster of khajimba in early and his replacement by aslan bzhania himself veteran of the kgb in south_ossetia anatoliy bibilov who had floated between the north and south ossetian militaries defeated tibilov actions have continued to ensure that georgian resentment over the remains an open wound the process of borderization continues in south_ossetia border troops periodically erect border fences that enclose bits of land hitherto under georgian control in july border fences cut off of the strategic baku supsa oil pipeline the line that carried azerbaijani early oil to market in the west before the main baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline was completed has not interfered with the oil flow but the implied threat is clear for its it appears that georgia under saakashvili tried to return this threat by reopening links with chechen and islamist rebel groups in the north caucasus as shevardnadze had done with the chechen commander gelayev in charged in and again in after murky incident in the lopota gorge between the pankisi gorge and dagestan that georgia was arming and training chechen militants to fight inside in several years after saakashvili was replaced by the less anti georgian dream party the chechen commander involved in the lopota incident was killed by georgian security forces in tbilisi thus cycle of perceived provocations followed by emotional reactions and retaliations continues today most recently mere choice of seating at meeting led to crisis between the countries june to the assembly on orthodoxy met in the parliament in tbilisi with orthodox countries in attendance this was presumably intended as gesture at reconciliation between the orthodox majorities of and georgia on june member of the state duma presided over the session and sat in the georgian parliament chair seat violent street protests immediately broke out in tbilisi disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation of georgia parliament chair the following amid continuing protests against in tbilisi putin ordered the cessation of direct flights between georgia and as he had in the run up to the war the incident highlights that symbols of power relations evoke both charged emotions and material retaliations and that the pattern of events be repeated for the foreseeable future it is hard not to conclude that putin personal overreach in ukraine has led to suboptimal results for in the south_caucasus when he resumed the presidency of putin increased engagement with the south_caucasus perhaps hoping to gather some castaway stones closer into the camp by autumn everything seemed to be going his way armenia and ukraine had bowed to his demands to reject association agreements with the eu and to sign on instead with the eaeu that putin had singlehandedly created promoted and dominated relations with azerbaijan were on an keel expenditure of effort and georgia despised saakashvili had been replaced by billionaire whose government was floating trial balloons about normalizing relations with moscow despite recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south_ossetia but relations with all three south_caucasus countries reverted to type after intervention in ukraine moscow stifling embrace of rulers such as sargsyan and khajimba led to popular discontent and their forcible ousters the precedents set on ukrainian territory led azerbaijan to proceed with extreme caution in its relations with and expansionist policies with regard to abkhazia and south_ossetia have guaranteed the hostility of the georgian populace and repudiation by what might have been friendlier government as observers have noted major outside powers such as china turkey and the eu have capitalized on local suspicions of they have developed strong interests in all three south_caucasus countries and have the wherewithal to defend those interests against maneuvering while also providing the locals with greater room for maneuver turkey willingness to major military role in support of azerbaijan in the fighting that began september shows that power no_longer has the deterrent effect it once did against intervention by outside powers interests themselves are not yet seriously threatened but expansion of those interests has been blunted can then that policies in the south_caucasus and in the wider post_soviet space have forced it on the stony path it

influential player in the fight against covid the damage done to the reputation years to repair this article is of fp round the clock coverage of the election results as they come in with short dispatches correspondents and analysts the world the page is free for all readers moscow in the presidential_election has become national obsession ordinary people who rely on state_controlled television as their main source of information have seen the topic pop up every on multiple talk shows among the elite the duel between president donald_trump and former vice_president joe_biden has become the favorite topic of conversation at fancy restaurants and in the corridors of power the prevailing view is that victory for biden would be bad for because democratic administration is expected to impose economic sanctions on moscow as punishment for its bad behavior and foremost for its interference in the presidential_election this view is widely shared by pro kremlin pundits senior officials and the executives of state owned enterprises and is promoted by the few remaining independent media outlets such as the newsletter daily staple in the information diet of the upper middle class more nuanced view on biden is held by some people working on issues in the government president who is not tainted by suspicion of being asset and who knows how to organize normal process for national_security discussions be able to restore some guardrails to the relationship and prevent further deterioration those people argue president biden would not be able to pay close attention to since he and his senior advisers be overwhelmed by domestic issues and otherwise focusing on china but possible democratic administration appears to be open to retaining some pillars of the arms_control regime and discussing rules of competition in cyberspace and it could be more clear eyed and therefore skeptical about the side effects and efficiency of sanctions as the united_states major tool in policy depend on who is put in senior positions such as secretary of state and national_security advisor and on the midlevel bureaucrats controlling the portfolio after relations nearly hit rock bottom on trump watch nobody in believes that four more years of trump could be good for moscow if trump is reelected the only silver lining be the deeper level of disarray in the western alliance and disengagement its partners that second trump term would likely bring for the kremlin schadenfreude over the gradual demise of pax americana would simply sugarcoat the risks and downsides of trump remaining in the white_house is senior_fellow at the carnegie moscow center twitter trending more foreign_policy despite some tough sanctions and tougher criticism has not topped americas foreign_policy priorities under president donald_trump who has appeared to have congenial relationship with his counterpart vladimir_putin however that could all change if democrat nominee joe_biden wins the november election according to experts who are weighing up the implications of biden presidency on relations at the very least analysts expect that victory for biden would increase tensions between washington and moscow and would raise the probability of sanctions on the country is already operating under international sanctions on some key sectors and officials close to putin for actions its annexation of crimea ukraine in interference in the election in and reported involvement in nerve agent attack in the in andrius tursa central and eastern europe advisor at teneo intelligence win for biden would improve transatlantic ties between the and europe and would see renewed commitment to nato that would be welcomed by europe however he also such result would mean mostly downsides for citing recent history of mutual distrust and acrimonious relations between the kremlin and democrats in general potential biden presidency would be negative for moscow and likely lead to further deterioration of bilateral_relations both in terms of rhetoric and substance the democratic party candidate has maintained tough stance towards president_vladimir putin administration tursa in note friday the kremlin disdain for biden meanwhile dates to his vice presidency particularly his push for sanctions against in response to the ukrainian crisis meaningful conflict resolution over crimea and in the donbass region in east ukraine where there are pro regions that declared themselves republics still eludes moscow and kiev despite efforts by germany and france to broker lasting settlement that both_sides can live with tursa argued that tangible process in region biden was heavily involved in as vice_president moscow could hardly expect any meaningful easing of sanctions and that potential biden presidency could lead to more stringent enforcement of existing measures the risk of sanctions could also increase he any sanctions on are unlikely to be imposed immediately however according to timothy ash senior emerging markets strategist at bluebay asset management he on saturday that while do the course of relations remain on this deteriorating path am not sure that we should expect an immediate rollout of additional pent up sanctions on those candidates likely to be running affairs in biden presidency are all pretty experienced and level headed they won want to roll out sanctions for sanctions sake they want to be very proportionate and logical in approach he emphasizing that it important for the to have business like relationship with to ensure delivery on the strategic interests he the sides under biden presidency would have to learn where they can tolerate each_other and get along on certain areas of mutual interest such as arms_control and reducing risks of conflict where strategic interests compete for example on areas like ukraine belarus and turkey sanctions be of the tool kit herein but only such tool is an area that both watchers believe could be point of mutual interest and some harmony however biden has signaled as saying in that he would want to see an extension of the major nuclear arms reduction treaty known as the strategic arms reduction treaty or the implementation something similar based on recent statements both_sides negotiations on strategic arms reduction treaty start is area where progress could be expected if biden is elected teneo tursa however the timeline would be extremely challenging as the current treaty expires on february itself has acknowledged that arms_control could be positive dynamic under biden presidency earlier in october putin criticized what he called sharp anti rhetoric biden but also that he had been encouraged by biden comments regarding arms treaty or

and other younger people it seems aimed at intimidating students and faculty limiting free speech and academic freedom and falsely portraying critics and protesters as linked to foreign influence demanding information on politically active students and lecturers appears to be yet another attempt by authorities to stifle activism and academic freedom europe and central asia director at

that aim of the inspection is to uncover destructive foreign influence on younger generation it singles out the to report on among other things pro american groups of influence that can be used by international ngos trying to achieve their destructive goals the falsification of global and history to achieve the geopolitical interests of ani forces and the destruction of traditional spiritual and moral values nthe notification requires the academy to provide list of all of its international projects or programs funded abroad and to explain how they comply with law joint programs with foreign nongovernmental groups and any activities within the university by groups deemed undesirable in or threatening state security and the foundations of constitutional order the latter includes

effort to distance itself such activities nalthough the notice states that the inspection is based on laws on education the purpose is to require universities to monitor the peaceful and lawful activism of faculty and students with dissenting views which goes beyond the main goals of an educational organization human_rights watch the prosecutor order frames peaceful activism as something that is destructive and that should be monitored and rooted out williamson this is blatant violation of the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and assembly and fosters an atmosphere that

coordinated dissemination of disinformation pseudo state operations such as the internet research agency based in st_petersburg and financed by allies of putin are of particular concern they have been linked to dozens of international campaigns using troll farms of employees posting with fake accounts in addition to networks of automated bots to push disinformation on social_media these campaigns have been global in reach efforts in both south america and africa the countries of the former soviet bloc have been intensely targeted especially ukraine in the wake of the supported insurgency in eastern ukraine the united_states has been the target of what can appear to be bizarre cacophony of campaigns in addition to extensive campaigns supporting donald_trump leading up to the presidential elections campaigns at various points focused on hoax about poisoned thanksgiving turkeys an invented chemical plant explosion anti vaccination propaganda electoral college reform anti muslim immigration black lives matter and the organization of anti trump protests once he was in office for the most these campaigns have co opted existing organizations and content and repurposed and amplified their message the campaigns exploit existing political fault lines like race and regionalism to increase polarization and disaffection with the political system the complete lack of coherent message across these campaigns is jarring until realizes that the goal of the campaigns is not necessarily to convince anyone of anything but rather to generate noise we can see this in action when we look at the internal propaganda of the putin regime on specific topics like the malaysian airlines flight shot down over ukraine in in which plethora of completely contradictory and largely obviously fictional explanations were pushed simultaneously the proliferation of noise encourages the public to disbelieve everything and undermines the basic assumption that there is an objective truth that we

largely on the sidelines in but for the midterm elections the command took far more aggressive posture in addition to sending the teams to allied countries it to would be trolls before the vote in its offensive operation against moscow it then on election and the days afterward the operation was focused mostly on according to what is publicly known about it but before the election this intelligence officials have described efforts by iran and china as as to potentially influence the vote and cyber_command has also widened its focus since we have expanded our hunt forward operations to all major adversaries lt gen charles moore jr the deputy head of cyber_command in an interview in his office at fort meade cyber_command calls its work with allies to find enemy hackers hunt forward operations after getting close to foreign adversaries own networks cyber_command can then get inside to identify and potentially neutralize attacks on the united_states according to current and former officials we want to find the bad guys in red space in their own operating environment general moore we want to down the archer rather_than dodge the arrows officials would identify only regions and not the countries they had operated in before the election but cyber_command officials those efforts uncovered malware being used by adversarial hacking teams other government agencies used that information

to help them find identify and remove hostile intrusions on their government or military computer_networks for the allied nations inviting cyber_command operatives not only helps improve their network defenses but also demonstrates to adversaries that the united_states military is working with them for the united_states the deployments give their experts an early look at tactics that potential

and in silicon valley tech giants facebook twitter and google have been sending out statements every few days advertising how foreign influence operations they have blocked all while banning forms of

corporate executives is to disrupt honed information warfare systems whether they are poised to hack election systems amplify america political fissures or get inside the minds of voters but behind the scenes is careful dance by members of the trump administration to counter the president own disinformation campaign that the outcome on nov be rigged unless he wins so while president trump continues to dismiss the idea of intervention combination of administration and industry officials are pushing different narrative that intelligence_agencies facebook twitter google and others are avoiding the mistakes of four_years ago when they all had their radars off but there is also no assurance it work we don like to admit it but the russians not be deterrable james lewis the director of

assess the effectiveness of the until after election when washington circulates the cyberequivalent of battle damage reports but there are reasons to question whether the efforts to on some of which began in the midterm elections have been too timid it is hardly coincidence that the indictments announced on monday against hackers with were unsealed days before the election but it is unclear what deterrent effect indictments can have when the officers are unlikely to ever see the inside of an american courtroom of the hackers named in the indictment was previously charged with hacking election administrators four_years ago that did not stop him brazen hacking on the country of georgia last likewise after was outed for hacking the pyeongchang olympics that apparently did nothing to dissuade it british officials revealed monday john carlin the former assistant attorney general for national_security who developed of the justice department strategy for indicting foreign hackers and later wrote about it in the book dawn of the code war mr trump denial of what happened four_years ago gave lots of leeway the details in the indictment are stunning and reveal operatives at the direction of the state attacking the whole world he adding that the conspicuous absence of leadership president trump on the issue was all the more striking given the efforts to expose and disrupt this activity these attacks on countries and civilian behavior won stop until the commander in chief calls it out and works with the rest of the victimized world to deter future indiscriminate attacks mr carlin if the indictments are the public face of the offensive against the russians the effort to dismantle trickbot vast network of infected computers used by ransomware groups is the more covert element late last_month the military cyber_command started neutralizing trickbot with series of attacks microsoft digital crimes unit secured federal court orders to shut_down trickbot infrastructure the world on tuesday microsoft the operation had been largely successful it has taken down over percent of trickbot command and control servers the idea is to keep the russians on the run so distracted that they are unable to those systems for ransomware attacks that could hold the election hostage these guys are really good and really move fast and we knew they would react to rebuild their systems tom burt the microsoft executive who is running the team we were prepared to follow them and tear down whatever they build up but as cyber_command and microsoft were taking aim at trickbot hacking threat emerged over the past months different group of hackers known as energetic bear or dragonfly and believed to be operating within the country federal security service or the successor to the soviet_era has been targeting american state and local networks according to government and private security researchers their goal is still unclear but the timing so close to the election and the actor which was have sent alarm bells ringing at cyber_command and at security firms like fireeye cyberscoop of leaked fireeye report on the campaign on monday officials worry that if those hackings do not amount to the russians very presence inside state and local systems could be used to support the president baseless allegations that the election is rigged that was of the motivation behind an unusual nine

philippines and assets it has also lowered its tolerance for disinformation after years of allowing holocaust deniers place on its platform facebook started censoring that content this month and stepping up its crackdown of qanon which promotes conspiracy that the world is run by satan worshiping pedophiles plotting against mr trump the question is whether these efforts so late in the

with the apparent goal of dissuading them supporting the biden harris ticket sign up for cnn opinions join us on and both countries are cooperating more than ever but would moscow really help beijing in that way has the knowledge but china has the money would moscow help beijing for the right price it appears that china is relying on how and experience to develop the reactor for its nuclear aircraft carrier as the reports china appears to be studying the nuclear reactors on largest icebreakers an approach that the soviet_union also took when it planned to build nuclear carriers in the specifically has invited china to bid on the construction of class of nuclear icebreaker necessarily requiring the development of surface ship based reactors this approach stands in contrast to how the united_states and france developed nuclear reactors for their largest carriers but probably represents the best choice for china at this point to appreciate what at stake in china pursuit of nuclear powered surface warships it important to review the experience of the united_states and the ussr after the successful development of the uss and the class nuclear attack submarines as as the merchant ship ns provided proof of concept regarding nuclear propulsion the usn began to evaluate nuclear power for surface warships the usn nuclear surface warship was the cruiser uss commissioned in was powered by ws reactors generating mw enough power to produce speed of knots for the ton cruiser hull the usn rapidly followed up with uss enterprise powered by reactors each quite similar in construction and output to the those reactors generated mw each translating to shp driving the ton at up to knots few other nuclear cruisers and destroyers followed but the advantages of nuclear power in surface warfare ships was limited by cost aircraft carriers were different story the class which began to enter service in reactors each rated at mw the recently commissioned uss carries reactors capable of generating mw the extra power generation capacity of the has little to do with speed rather the power provides surplus usable for variety of different systems emals and highly sophisticated sensors down the road the extra energy power point defense lasers and similar equipment overall the reactors open up space to modernize and modify the vessels keeping them effective for their decades of project life the soviet experience was somewhat different while the soviets enjoyed considerable success in developing nuclear reactors for submarines they approached the question of surface warships more carefully the nuclear powered soviet ship was the icebreaker commissioned in with three ok reactors mw each between and the soviets would commission nine more nuclear icebreakers of the and classes generally displacing between and tons and carrying ok reactors capable of mw these ships provided valuable experience but the soviets were slow to the leap to nuclear powered surface combatants in because soviet warships were expected to operate closer to home than their counterparts in however the soviets began building the of four ships of the class ton battlecruisers with both nuclear and conventional propulsion reports differ on the power capacity of the kn reactors with range mw to mw these reactors would also have powered the class supercarriers class of ships that was canceled upon the collapse of the ussr the chinese are undoubtedly thinking along lines similar to those of the late soviets be conventional catobar carrier suggest ship roughly the size and sophistication of the which of course would require immense power generation capabilities like the united_states china wants excess power generation in order to field suite of future weapons and sensors for this purpose china needs reactors more powerful than those that it currently uses on its submarines and building icebreakers for provide the necessary experience this approach stands in contrast to that of the french navy which decided to upscale based on experience building nuclear reactors for submarines while france has enjoyed success with nuclear subs the is widely believed to be underpowered relative to other fleet carriers uses areva reactors the same type as employed on french submarines these reactors provide mw each but only drive the ton carrier some knots it worth noting that india considered but wisely rejected the idea of building ins vishal as nuclear carrier largely because of the technical challenges of developing powerful enough reactor the idea of using technical and nuclear how certainly makes sense the perspective of the people liberation army navy the plan doesn have the luxury of the incremental approach adopted by the united_states and has good reason to find the french approach insufficient to its needs that the russians seem okay with letting the chinese study their icebreakers suggests once again that moscow and beijing currently see cooperation as in their term interests of course nothing be certain until china nuclear carrier actually enters service perhaps sometime copyright all rights_reserved updated_gmt hkt_october it is

month firms separately announced plans that would put them in direct competition yandex the internet and search company the online bank tinkoff while the banking giant sberbank unveiled suite of technology products just days later as the reported analysts also point out that is overdue digitization surge and there could easily be room for both to emerge winners but behind this is another conflict the kremlin ever expanding attempts to bring technology firms in under the state control both companies have played role in these efforts yandex has been under kremlin to give the government more influence over its decisions and sberbank is state owned enterprise the latter is by the government corporate takeovers such as yandex acquisition of tinkoff are pushing major tech_companies into ever growing conglomerates controlled either directly by the government or by other actors trusted to advance kremlin internet policy but the kremlin toolkit of coercion is broader and more international than this tactic the government has recognized the scale of political and economic power wielded by internet companies and sought to channel that power toward its own ends since war against ukraine the government has carried out rapidly escalating crackdown on internet freedom but the hostile attitude toward freedom of information underlying internet policy has changed little since vladimir_putin took office in the kremlin strategy for the internet has in ways mirrored the approaches used early in the putin era to bring major broadcast and print media then the major means of information dissemination under effective government control at that the internet played no meaningful role in how most of the public read the or communicated with another and therefore escaped major attempts at government interference in the years since however as the importance of dramatically in as in most of the world controlling the internet has become higher priority for government willing to ever more authoritarian tactics in addition to its efforts to control online media outlets the government in recognition of the internet power as tool for communication has prioritized maximizing its surveillance potential and enlisted social_media and other tech_companies in this push through publicly enacted measures it has created legal and technological framework for the internet in under which only encryption rather_than any legal protection can effectively prevent the authorities viewing the content of any internet traffic within the country third goal which receives surprisingly little attention relative to its potential significance is to enlist internet companies in the government foreign espionage efforts this topic be downplayed due to justified cynicism it would of course be naive to assume that the government is alone in such conduct as authoritarian and democratic governments alike regularly demand user information most often calling it necessary for the criminal justice process but has had unique case made public in april pavel durov the founder of vkontakte known as vk most popular social_media platform he received the previous december the country federal security service fsb which is responsible for domestic security but also foreign electronic surveillance the letter demanded the personal of users running popular vk groups involved in the ukrainian euromaidan protests movement that would ultimately result in the ouster of ukrainian president viktor yanukovych the fsb demands demonstrate the power of the government to requisition user privately owned social_media companies expressly in order to conduct espionage abroad what sets this apart the surveillance practices of most democratic governments the united_states is the lack of any political or legal checks that could serve to protect users privacy when edward snowden disclosure of the prism program revealed that intelligence was collecting social_media platforms such surveillance became major story in politics tech_companies on their users behalf changed their practices to better protect user government collection and to challenge its surveillance practices earning praise the american civil liberties union and other privacy activists in where the putin regime had already destroyed judicial independence asserted control of most media outlets and seriously weakened civil_society durov revelation had little impact on public discourse surveillance and the tech sector already by that point largely under kremlin control produced no comparable response vk story is illustrative of of the different tactics broadly employed by the government in its efforts to gain control when durov published his letter the fsb four months after receiving it he had already fled that final conflict was only the latest in between durov and the government that included an incident when durov refused prosecutor order to down vk pages being used to organize protests against fraudulent parliamentary elections provoking police special forces raid on his apartment raids by masked and armed police on the offices of tech_companies and the homes of their owners are as they are to some extent in all profitable parts of the economy these extortion tactics are often paired with corporate ownership maneuvers aimed at bringing those companies under the ownership of state_controlled companies or kremlin friendly businessmen in the case of vk the personal pressure against durov occurred against backdrop of tech giant owned by the billionaire and close putin ally alisher usmanov to acquire controlling stake in vk when mail ru few months after durov fled the company added most popular social network to product portfolio that already included its namesake email service the most used webmail provider in and odnoklassniki the country second most popular social network corporate consolidation in the tech sector poses problems for freedom of expression and information everywhere in however the primary driving force behind such consolidation is not the companies own economic motivations but rather the government political aims in the case of mail ru these platforms were under the control of an owner ready and willing to his immense wealth and power to and to that merger however was not the end of the kremlin of corporate takeovers as an instrument to control the country tech giants yandex which in addition to operating most used search engine maintains aggregator that is the single most popular source on the internet and therefore has similarly been to but yandex did not directly result these tactics instead the most proximate cause was the threat of legislation that would limit or prohibit foreign ownership of tech_companies in this case the relevant legislation was directly intended to pressure yandex into corporate restructuring evidenced by the fact that the legislation was introduced in during sberbank takeover attempt and then withdrawn after yandex voluntarily restructured other legislation however has constrained the activities of companies in number of ways going beyond ownership the government surveillance system known by the acronym sorm has infrastructure since the with updates implemented to capture more internet and mobile phone communications as technology evolved companies have little ability to push as sorm gives the fsb the capability and the legal right to collect private companies those companies knowledge law allowing internet oversight agency roskomnadzor to order the blocking of websites supposedly engaged in criminal activity to censor political speech leaving publishers and users of blocked sites no legal recourse most recently the yarovaya and sovereign internet laws which entered into force in and respectively have and undermined any remaining legal or technical capacity that they might have to protect user privacy surveillance or supply users with uncensored information outside the country all of this leads to grim conclusion barring dramatic political reforms the tech business sector can no_longer be source of independent action on behalf of free internet in and russians seeking to the internet for private communications and uncensored information have to turn elsewhere the outlook for international companies while certainly more optimistic is also less clear moscow goals when it comes to international technology companies those incorporated in other countries but operating in are quite similar to those it pursues with domestic firms authorities want to maximize surveillance potential disrupt any possibility of domestic political unrest as result of those companies content or services and continue projecting disinformation through the internet recent battles over localization or the mandated storage of certain kinds of within borders exemplify the kremlin desire to maximize its own surveillance potential through foreign companies like authoritarian governments that viewed the internet free information flows as threat to regime security moscow in that companies with on citizens store it locally firms could maintain copies of the elsewhere but the itself had to sit in servers within the broad legal and political jurisdiction of the security services described above in recent years companies like facebook and twitter have seemingly just these orders and continued paying the trivial court ordered but pressures are likely to grow as putin further moves to cement state control over storage fit into broader picture of government efforts to centralize internet flows designed at the internet inception to prioritize fast and reliable delivery above all else to enable more effective government management and surveillance though the process is often purely technical the objectives are fundamentally political in practice these measures allow the government to surveil dissidents ensure the privacy of citizen against perceived malicious foreign access and extend state information control in the digital domain simultaneously justifying of the kremlin other main goals in this sphere disrupting the potential for political pluralism enabled by foreign tech platforms and projecting the state own disinformation through those same vectors requires kind of argumentative gymnastics the government has for years required foreign internet companies operating in to remove content it deems false should companies not comply the kremlin has vested powers in roskomnadzor to initiate technical blocks on those websites although these blocks are often evaded or poorly implemented the government has still managed to pressure foreign companies to related to the covid crisis this minimizes the presence of state critical or contradictory information online in at the same government propaganda outlets often have large presence in major western platforms like twitter and youtube and officials anytime those firms action against state_controlled outlets these inherent contradictions in the government approach to international tech_companies the kremlin wants these companies to operate in but only on the kremlin own terms it pressures companies to suppress free speech inside but howls when government messaging abroad is met with wariness mean that there is still space for international companies to effect certain extent of internet freedom for citizens this operating space however is under constant threat the government and is likely to be the site of several major conflicts in coming years international firms continue to push against certain elements of state internet control firms that have mostly resisted complying with localization rules have not indicated any changed willingness to follow kremlin pressure though resistance of this kind won apply to every area online it important to not group different components of internet control here content takedowns for example are domain of internet control in the covid pandemic where the government was quite successful in getting social_media companies to their platforms within that officials deemed false second the struggle to maintain free internet in increasingly be defined by technical dimensions the government in june decided to on telegram the encrypted messaging app essentially it lacked the technical capacity to block it ironically this comprises certain kind of payback for none other than pavel durov telegram creator who since losing vk and fleeing has built his messaging app into of the world most popular the sovereign internet law that came into force in for developing pernicious technical censorship capabilities perhaps most ominously the ability to selectively censor content on international social_media platforms in while maintaining plausible deniability it also required domestic internet companies to centralize their architecture so authorities could potentially cut off the internet the rest of the world in the event of security incident broadly defined thus it be incumbent on supporters of internet freedom to continue developing anti censorship technology and maintain the kind of technical edge that has allowed telegram to continue operating in compromising on surveillance or censorship full disclosure of the authors of this article works for company that develops anti censorship software and with moscow advancing internet control domestically officials continue seeking the normalization of this practice on the global stage recently these efforts have focused on the united nations where the state has proposed alternative cybercrime treaties that seek to justify its repressive internet policies and practices clashing with free and open internet norms upheld by democracies worldwide in december for the of these proposals an indicator of broader support among governments for tighter internet control this was not an accidental occurrence instead it spotlights to spread their authoritarian worldview and undermine global free and open internet model amid democratic uncertainty on the future of the internet these outcomes should also serve as reminder to tech_companies policymakers and anyone who cares about maintaining an open global internet that internet freedom is neither inevitable nor permanent domestic internet sector once model of pluralism and independent thought has been thoroughly subverted to the ends of the government as once global internet splinters into it concerted opposition effort to maintain

member writes he outlines where in the siberian city of krasnoyarsk he needs to do house visits and waits for the ping of response the chat group drive doctor on viber currently connects doctors state hospitals with hundreds of volunteers willing to drive them patient to patient often for hours on end it has been buzzing with notifications and positive energy since the end of october when it was created by journalists local television channel the chat was inspired by similar group in neighboring irkutsk didn believe until the very last moment that it would work of the doctors elena kolchina of her request for help in the chat after all we doctors have gotten used to just relying on ourselves suddenly this young girl arrived and she drive me almost threw my arms her neck in happiness she told dw in phone interview the thing is in comparison to the wave of coronavirus the second isn wave it more of tsunami kolchina estimates that the number of patients requiring care at home has doubled in that is because covid cases and suspected cases are receiving treatment and testing at home in krasnoyarsk city of just over million people doctors hospitals often dont have enough vehicles to cover the huge number of house calls they are doing so help the volunteer drivers the doctors would have to walk to reach their patients in full protective gear and in temperatures that have fallen below zero some of the most active volunteers met in person for the this week before busy of driving several of the drivers tell dw they have been working or hour days along with the doctors who they are the real heroes volunteers coaxing to allow us to their names out of modesty of them is valentina briukhanova see header photo the old works in the city administration and has been volunteering for over week in her vacation saw messages my friends saying they were waiting for doctors for days on end and every saw the rising coronavirus numbers understood that doctors aren managing to deal with the onslaught of sick people so decided to help briukhanova in message every the nurses and doctors tell me that if didn drive them they wouldn have gotten to of their patients at all recently people in the city have started recognizing the drivers and bringing them and their passengers food and drinks has so far shied away introducing national lockdown instead introducing limited protective measures has the of coronavirus infections worldwide on friday the country broke the mark for daily infections the kremlin spokesperson dmitry_peskov the situation is tense but under control while admitting mishaps in regions boris ovchinnikov of the founders of the insight an commerce research agency believes that case numbers outside of the capital are likely five or times higher than though he numbers for moscow which has seen about quarter of current cases are likely quite accurate ovchinnikov has been using search engine on losing your sense of smell common сoronavirus symptom that is rare in other infectious diseases to calculate the spread of covid across the analyst the method is independent of current testing levels and of the level of honesty of individual regional authorities on thursday representative of the health ministry up to of coronavirus tests could be showing false results ovchinnikov particularly points to siberia as facing the most dramatic situation in the country in the siberian city of tomsk local journalist reported that people were being offered seats at hospital because there are no more beds in omsk the minister of health was recently fired after several ambulance workers drove seriously ill coronavirus patients right up to the ministry in protest at failing to find free hospital bed for them vladimir_putin recently that more hospital beds to be provided in response to shortages the krasnoyarsk region which has population of just under million is no exception official coronavirus statistics place it in the top of russias most affected regions with total of just under infections and deaths last_week deputy_prime minister tatyana golikova the situation is critical in of regions in krasnoyarsk because at_least of hospital beds are currently occupied there activist anastasia korsakova the coordinator of the opposition politician aleksei navalny headquarters in krasnoyarsk thinks is an understatement of the catastrophic situation in the region she insists instead there are no beds left there at all as if to avoid further negative headlines the ministry of health last_week banned medical personnel publicly commenting on the coronavirus situation official permission local krasnoyarsk journalists sergei grigoriev and maria bukhtueva came up with the idea of connecting doctors to volunteer drivers journalist maria bukhtueva of the creators of the krasnoyarsk chat connecting drivers with doctors the fear among medics is palpable lot of people here have had to choice the doctors should they accept the help being offered in the chat and by doing so admit that something is wrong with the system or should they stay silent and pretend that everything is alright she comments over the phone the volunteer drivers are also battling their own fears and taking personal risk if the doctors provide them with after all doctors who arent in delegated coronavirus teams are coming in contact with suspected covid cases people desire to help has become basic bukhtueva there is sense that there is almost war going on war with the coronavirus doctor donish azizmurodov told dw that after getting help the drivers he plans to volunteer in his free the volunteers agree all of them admit they are afraid of getting sick you can get infected anywhere at the supermarket on public transportation outside wherever so being scared is pointless roman old engineer viktor alekseev another driver we all perfectly that we can get sick but knowing that you are healthy for and can help lot of people instead of sitting at home and waiting for disaster to come knocking that forces you to get your act together every of the drivers explain they want of what they are doing as child was told that if

ruling party united in the ensuing years the kremlin sought to neutralize this political upstart by charging him for several murders committed in to the authorities surprise furgal arrest triggered mass demonstrations in khabarovsk and other cities while the protests received only limited coverage on state tv channels about them spread like wildfire across social networks and youtube where live broadcasts are targeted to hipper younger audience but unlike in the soviet_era when the hacks on the screen could not hear you those read the comments and are responsive to viewer demand though the protesters in khabarovsk were far other population centers they knew they were being watched and supported by millions of people across before youtube transformed politics journalists here had started to lose all hope of working in the profession they understood that the choice was either to produce state propaganda or hazard the risks of pursuing genuine public interest journalism if you chose the latter the authorities would do whatever they could to ruin you financially enjoy unlimited access to the ideas and opinions of the world leading thinkers weekly reads book reviews and interviews annual print magazine special edition print magazine the complete archive and more but with youtube can real money doing genuine journalism aleksei pivovarov former star of state television left that world in the mid and launched on youtube in the channel features serious coverage of critical national topics following all the principles of old fashioned journalism with high quality images on the ground reporting and interviews with parties on all sides of given issue with such content absent television for so these online channels have quickly attracted millions of viewers which translates into millions of rubles advertising moreover the popularity of independent media on youtube explodes the myth that russians do not care about politics youtube figures have quickly adapted in order to reach wider audiences for example yuri dud former sports journalist has cultivated large intellectually curious passionate following initially featuring interviews with and talk show hosts he has branched out into coverage of and other figures dud has had major successes with what once might have seemed like money losing stories for example his videos on and the beslan school have garnered tens of millions of views equally important dud audience is dominated not by the urban liberal intelligentsia but by schoolchildren and students dud knows how to engage young people online and he has been telling supposedly apolitical under what is really happening in their country finally among the greatest success stories associated with the media is main opposition_leader whom state tv did not mention by name until very recently in august navalny was with the nerve agent novichok and then airlifted to berlin for treatment whereupon state media finally started acknowledging his existence referring to him as the berlin patient hooligan on the internet and just blogger navalny of course has been banned state tv but that is no_longer problem he recently granted dud an interview berlin and that received more than million views within days of being released there is no_longer any doubt that youtube has become main platform for political journalism and unlike on state tv its leading voices cannot get away with shoddy work or mistakes lest they lose viewers and thus their chance at fame and fortune the big question of course is how these online channels can stay open as matters stand post_soviet factotums still underestimate the power of youtube or are aware of it and that an outright ban would bring people into the streets on scale beyond anything seen in modern history is not north_korea it is home to generation of brave free people who increasingly do not bother with state tv and growing number of older russians have begun to follow this generation lead it doesn hurt

the west according to ekaterina kotrikadze television has been the most powerful sector of the media industry in and the main source for most russians for generations in the soviet_era and today though the audience is aware of the lies disinformation and propaganda aired on state_controlled tv viewers glue themselves to the screens every to relax after hours of work they do so out of force of habit inertia and laziness and it is honored routine for of the population due to censorship channels critical of the kremlin had been taken off air today has just independent liberal tv channel dozhd tv the author employer which has been excluded main cable packages hence the independent tv station with strong online presence is not available to russians and they tend to resort to whatever is available knowing full that they can believe word they hear the experts and officials who appear there the author the dominance of tv has been eroded by the internet in recent years the total number of internet users in aged over was million in equating to more than of the population according to state owned audience researcher mediascope this has ushered in developments in journalism for decades viewers had no alternative to state_controlled tv today can inform themselves online learning facts and truths that have eluded them meanwhile has increasingly come to be divided between parallel realities the familiar post_soviet and delivered by youtube where can watch live broadcasts of rallies and protests deep investigations into official corruption and interviews with people who have been blacklisted state television channels online networks monitored by serious journalists have quickly attracted millions of viewers which translates into millions of rubles advertising this debunks the myth that russians do not care about politics for the being there is little the kremlin can do about this trend the author points out that before youtube transformed politics journalists here had started to lose all hope of working in the profession they understood that the choice was either to produce state propaganda or hazard the risks of pursuing genuine public interest journalism if you chose the latter the authorities would do whatever they could to ruin you financially the author sees the success of yuri dud former sports journalist as case in point he has cultivated large intellectually curious passionate following initially featuring interviews with rappers and talk show hosts he has branched out into coverage of politicians and other figures he also knows how to engage young people online and he has been telling supposedly apolitical under what is really happening in their country his berlin interview earlier this month with most famous dissident alexei navalny who was airlifted to germany for medical treatment after being poisoned with novichok in august has been watched over million times within days there is no_longer any doubt that youtube has become main platform for political journalism and unlike on state tv its leading voices cannot get away with shoddy work or mistakes lest they lose viewers and thus their chance at fame and fortune it is gift for journalists that they can combine making money and engaging in serious journalism on youtube and that authorities are also gradually realizing that they must reckon with the real world consequences of this virtual world as putin has gone to extreme lengths to control the flow of information in it raises the big question how these online channels can stay open as matters stand post_soviet factotums still underestimate the power of youtube or are aware of it and that an outright ban would bring people into the streets on scale beyond anything seen in modern history the author remains optimistic insisting that is not north_korea it is home to generation of brave free people who increasingly do not bother with state tv and growing number of older russians have begun to follow this generation lead it doesn hurt that most tvs can be connected to the internet where fact based reality awaits viewers so far there is step putin has not yet taken shutting down youtube of his initiatives upon taking office years_ago was to bring independent tv networks under his control as youtube has replaced tv in the and entertainment diets of russians under it has become the go

took to the air yesterday with engine this marks major development in ongoing program to relaunch production of the cold_war era missile carrier since no photos of the engined bomber have so far been released it not yet possible to determine the identity of the particular blackjack or whether all four of the turbofans are already installed the united aircraft corporation which has manufacturing responsibility for the blackjack announced that the deeply modernized tu had performed its flight with its serial production nk engines at the kazan aircraft production association airfield in southwest on november the flight lasted hours and minutes and saw the bomber climb to height of over feet with the crew led by test pilot anri naskidyants state owned agency reported that the flight went smoothly adding that the aircraft was equipped with flight and navigation equipment an onboard communications system modernized control system radar and lack of engines had been serious hurdle in moscow ambitious plans to restart production of the blackjack which had originally come to halt in after just examples three of them non flying static test airframes had been completed with the collapse of the soviet_union of the tu left in ukrainian territory were scrapped another four of the bombers were left unfinished on the assembly line and of these were eventually completed in and today the aerospace_forces fleet is thought to include blackjacks which have performed number of high profile in recent years as as regular patrol flights then in april minister of defense sergey shoygu announced that production of the tu was to be resumed ahead of this the company in southwestern city of samara received contract to restart production of the blackjack nk turbofans producing an improved nk version the of these engines was planned to be ready for tests in and some observers have expected that the same powerplant to be used in still secretive and still unseen pak_da generation bomber as as powering build blackjacks the nk is required to keep tu the original production run operational of the tu the original production run over the river volga during mission its home base at engels in the saratov region the kuznetsov nk as installed in the original tu is widely reported as the most powerful combat aircraft engine in the world developing over pounds of thrust at full afterburner while the nk is considered engine it actually dates to the mid when the soviet_union canceled its production on cost grounds the improvements over the initial design included blades for the compressor and turbine plus more efficient cooling the nk is understood to have the same output as the original powerplant but offers increased efficiency extending the bomber range by kilometers or just over miles according to media reports tupolev has in the past claimed percent overall range increase the program to get the blackjack into production has been protracted perhaps not altogether surprisingly as the effort to reinstate production line and setup required tooling after decades of inactivity is considerable in january the ministry of defense signed contract for the next build blackjacks which cost million per copy plans called for example for the aerospace_forces to be rolled out in according to this schedule is still on track in the past the aerospace_forces have declared requirement for build tu aircraft of the aerospace_forces original batch of tu undergoes overhaul in kazan in in parallel with the production blackjacks has been busy with mid life upgrade program for its existing tu mission systems and avionics originally the existing bombers were to be designated tu after completing their upgrade while the build aircraft would be designated tu this has been rationalized and both variants are known as tu ms therefore the aircraft to be engined with the nk turbofans is not build blackjack but either an example the earlier production batch that has been brought up to tu status or prototype for the build aircraft constructed using of the incomplete airframes the original production run of these unfinished aircraft has been completed as tu perhaps to serve as proof of concept for the build bombers this aircraft was and began flight trials in january it is named after the former air force chief the most recent blackjack to be completed is which has been finished to tu standard meanwhile deeply modernized tu based on an aircraft the original production series named performed its maiden flight at kazan in february the aircraft was originally built in february and was of eight blackjacks purchased by ukraine in after the fleet had been left there following the dissolution of the soviet_union the full tu configuration includes novella radar as as self defense suite and electronic surveillance system the flight deck is equipped with glass cockpit and the revised avionics encompass the communication suite flight control system and navigation suite alongside the deeply modernized tu has also been performing less extensive upgrade on its blackjack fleet at rate of or aircraft per this is the so called small modernization or tu and provides digital upgrade for the aircraft inertial navigation and engine control systems as as armament deputy_prime minister yuri borisov has the aerospace_forces continue to operate modernized tu ms both upgraded and build examples until the or the considering the blackjack can deploy conventional weapons as as nuclear ones and have been in the syrian campaign it unsurprising that wants to get the most out of its supersonic strategic bombers on the other hand the continued focus on the blackjack the tricky task of bringing it into production should be seen against the prospects for the future pak_da which stands for perspektivnyi aviatsionnyi kompleks dalney aviatsii or future air complex of range aviation the research and development program for the pak_da began the order to resume tu production that suggests that difficulties faced by the pak_da program led to the bomber program priority being reduced in favor of the tried and tested blackjack to this there has been no official concept art of the pak_da so we really have no idea what the design looks like however most observers expect that it be subsonic flying wing design possibly with low observable stealthy features tupolev concept for the pak_da was apparently approved in after which the united aircraft corporation received follow on contract for detailed design work and other contracts to develop the aircraft systems the then commander of range aviation branch anatoly zhikharev in late that pak_da prototype would fly in in however the idea of resuming series production of the tu appeared and with this the urgency assigned to the pak_da seems to have diminished indeed speaking in deputy_prime minister borisov described that relaunching production of the blackjack was less risky path than the pak_da at the same we have postponed the pak_da to gain experience and restore technology he added borisov predecessor dmitry rogozin had the same that the pak_da would perform its flight in or the prospects of the pak_da taking to the air in that kind of timeframe seem remote especially as the focus is on the tu continued upgrade and production restart which consume both funding and production capacity at the kazan plant meanwhile similar upgrade programs for the and strategic bombers further reduce the urgency of getting the pak_da into service there is also the enormous cost involved in getting sophisticated clean sheet design into production and service in meaningful numbers moscow planned purchases of generation fighters currently stand at just and other expensive weapons programs have been while the pak_da looks like it have to wait in the wings sometime longer the tu at_least provide the aerospace_forces with very capable stopgap sign up for our newsletter technology performance

less than weeks before election us intelligence and law_enforcement officials convened last minute to warn that foreign adversaries were once again interfering in american democracy iran was spreading false tales about allegedly fraudulent ballots and sending spoofed emails purporting to contain threats the proud_boys designed to intimidate voters incite social unrest and damage president trump john ratcliffe the director of national intelligence meanwhile both and iran had obtained access to voter information that could be used to cause confusion sow chaos and undermine your confidence in american democracy he warned it was everything that democrats and disinformation experts have been warning about for the last four_years except not quite the email operation had been relatively small and immediately debunked while voter roll information is either public or easy to obtain senior intelligence officials quickly raised doubts about ratcliffe emphasis on the threat iran over and questioned whether his motives for the public announcement were political the reported it was very difficult to see those men in suits talking about interference in the election when the white_house is the interfering with the election claire wardle the executive director of draft group that researches and combats disinformation after all when it comes to intimidating voters or inciting social unrest nothing has had more impact than the constant drumbeat of lies and disinformation years of preparation by the press social_media platforms and civil_society groups for foreign interference campaign against the us electoral process have been upended by the bizarre reality that the biggest threat to american democracy right is almost certainly the commander in chief and that his primary mode of attack is concerted disinformation campaign because how impact can telling voters in florida and alaska to vote for trump or else have on voters compared with trump directly the proud_boys neo fascist street gang to stand and stand by before television of million people and what kind of false tale of voter fraud could iran possibly seed that could undermine americans faith in the electoral process more than the disinformation about voter fraud and mail in ballots coming straight the white_house and trump campaign don trust the electoral system don trust the cdc don trust your neighbor because they probably antifa don trust the left wardle of trump election message it not about persuading people way or the other it about making them scared and causing confusion and chaos she added the media been obsessed with russians under the bed but to have the president of the united_states telling people in the us that they can trust the results of the election putin could only dream of that kind of thing disinformation campaign in the presidential_election had main vectors social_media campaign to sow division and distrust among voters and hack and leak operation that resulted in the theft and publication of emails and documents stolen democrats and hillary clinton campaign that hack and leak operation was incredibly successful with caches of stolen material proving irresistible both for the mainstream press and for conservative activists and conspiracy theorists people have been overwhelmed with falsehoods and confusion when people get overwhelmed they either fight or flee the iteration of the hack and leak tactic trump attorney rudy giuliani pushing dubious emails and text messages supposedly obtained hard drive linked to joe_biden son hunter has been something of damp squib however you don see the same kind of credulous knee jerk out of control amplification that you saw in whitney phillips professor at syracuse university and author of report examining how the press served the purposes of media manipulators trolls and hate groups in the top newspapers have debunked and deflated giuliani claims and the idea of the pilfered hard drive has failed to capture the public interest in the same way that troves of stolen emails did but while the trump election campaign have failed to recapture the magic of when it comes to hacked emails the president has taken social_media playbook and supercharged it with the power of the white_house sure that there is some foreign influence stuff happening and we might more about it later phillips but so of the pollution is trickling down the white_house itself and people have been absolutely overwhelmed with falsehoods and confusion over covid and ballots when people get overwhelmed they either fight or flee trump is making it almost impossible for people not to get totally burned out and disgusted this disinformation efforts on social_media have taken aim at familiar societal fault lines both operatives and the in targeted with messages designed to depress enthusiasm for clinton and suppress their votes similar efforts especially those are under way this election shireen mitchell disinformation researcher and founder of stop online violence against women there are groups working to basically remove us the democratic party and tell us story that matches what we going through speaks our language mitchell of campaigns such as blexit and walk away version of black voter suppression that mitchell is monitoring encourages people to votedownballot but abstain voting for either presidential candidate because both candidates are the same often alongside the hashtag ados which stands for american descendants of slaves jacobo licona disinformation researcher for equis labs he was tracking prominent far right latino facebook pages pushing false information about voting and anti black lives matter messages efforts to paint biden as socialist are also particularly effective among cuban and venezuelan immigrant communities he noted the false idea that biden is socialist or communist is also tactic in messages targeting some asian american voters apparently effective attack suggesting that biden had opposed accepting refugees after the vietnam war spread like wildfire within the vietnamese american community the source of the canard appeared to be article that was published in but went viral on facebook in october biden did support allowing vietnamese refugees to come the us while trump has attacked all forms of immigration reducing the number of refugees admitted each to an older vietnamese were especially angry about that thu quach an epidemiologist who helped to found progressive volunteer organization fighting misinformation among vietnamese americans through bilingual it takes lot of deep work to continue these conversations because it so deeply embedded to be anti communist and conservatives feed off that to paint biden and harris as communists tech platforms after belatedly and begrudgingly admitting their tools had been used to ill ends in have made reforms that some of the old tactics obsolete the trump campaign of facebook to target black voters with voting deterrence messages recently confirmed by is the kind of digital dirty trickery that should no_longer be possible every newsroom should be very very careful about what they publish because they are going to become tools in the fight such reforms be reason trump has been so openly fanning the flames of political violence whether through his debate message to the proud_boys or his call for his supporters to become poll watchers joan donovan research director at harvard shorenstein center on media politics and public policy they ve had to adapt to more mass media strategy she of the trump campaign if you can utilize those other mechanisms then you have to the megaphone trump blatant racism and ugly attacks on black women the democratic vice presidential nominee kamala harris and the congresswoman ilhan omar could also have the effect of suppressing turnout among black voters phillips simply by demoralizing people and inducing despair if certain people feel just crushed under the weight of so bullshit trump is going to be the to benefit she as volunteers like quach work to fight false narratives and voter confusion ahead of election however experts warn that the greatest scope for disinformation still be to come the surge in mail in ballots is likely to delay the final results and trump has repeatedly telegraphed his intention to declare premature victory or dismiss the election as rigged we going to look at and realize that it all going to play out pm on tuesday wardle misinformation flourishes when there vacuum or confusion and my fear is that there be lot of confusion and whoever succeeds in controlling the narrative be very placed in al gore never fully recovered television networks premature declaration that george bush had won florida wardle noted that made all the difference she we that trump closest circle is ready to deploy we that the militias are ready to deploy what we don is if newsrooms are ready for the absence of information wardle added every newsroom should be very very careful about what they publish because they are going to become tools in the fight and it going to be nasty energy minister moscow also focus on clean burning hydrogen and carbon capture has no plans to rein in its production of fossil fuels in the coming decades despite the global efforts to shift towards low carbon energy according to its energy minister alexander novak told the guardian that did not see that we achieve peak in gas production anytime soon because the world appetite for gas would continue to grow in the decades ahead despite its growing number of climate targets instead during in the battle to keep lid on rising global temperatures pair growth in gas production with plans to become global leader in producing and developing technology intends to ramp up gas production its vast and inexpensive reserves to reach tn cubic meters by just under bn cubic meters last it also plans to increase the amount of gas it exports on giant super chilled tankers more than four fold tonnes to tonnes while continuing to send about bn cubic meters of gas to europe via pipelines the believe natural gas to be an eco friendly energy source novak we believe that the share of natural gas in the global energy mix only increase we believe this to apply not only to but globally too energy economists forecast that demand for gas continue to grow particularly in asia as more countries draw line on burning coal which emits almost double the carbon dioxide of gas but eu demand for gas of which is met by state gas monopoly gazprom could fall below levels by the end of the decade according to novak also planned to become global player in the hydrogen economy by producing and transporting the clean burning alternative to traditional fossil fuel gas hydrogen can be produced either by using renewable energy to split water molecules in process known as electrolysis or by splitting off the carbon dioxide gas through pyrolysis novak was able to do both and was also developing technology to capture the carbon emissions created during hydrogen production to offer genuinely green gas to its customers using existing gas transport channels all this has been quite expensive so far but we believe that just like with the renewable energy sources which determine the pace of hydrogen adoption to put it briefly we can produce hydrogen and it as as deliver it to consumers we can also export the hydrogen production technologies novak pursuing hydrogen production would safeguard fossil fuel economy while helping to reduce emissions worldwide but environmental groups carbon action tracker have nonetheless branded climate plans the emissions targets set through the paris agreement are set against levels in which for marked its highest emissions on record the collapse of soviet_era industries in the early halved the country emissions within matter of years meaning it would very little effort for the kremlin to record emissions which are between lower than levels in by novak we are working very actively in pursuing the climate agenda working to decrease the greenhouse and co emissions and we working on these

introduced into service more than three decades ago today fully is modern according to study published by the international institute for strategic studies tank in london on september th warplanes have gone being legacy to being modern in that the key investments were in precision missiles like the land based iskander sea launched kalibr and air launched kh putting in range targets across europe see map decade ago the idea that the navy could accurately hit targets in syria warships in the caspian sea would have been science fiction notes dmitry stefanovich of research institute in moscow it reality in european war the idea would be to such missiles to threaten civilian and military infrastructure deep behind the front lines on the ground ensuring that conflict over tallinn would stretch far to the west of the rhine ultimate aim is to create reconnaissance strike complex originally soviet idea in which vehicles on the ground drones in the air satellites in space and radio signals emitted by enemy units are collected processed and fed into the weapons in real any sensor for instance drone can feed target to any shooter like faraway ship with targets prioritised centrally and struck ideally within minutes though is behind america and probably china in this ambitious endeavour it has made huge leaps dima adamsky of herzliya university in israel forces are not just better armed but also more fleet footed thanks to improvements in readiness could probably get troops complete with heavy armour to european hotspot within days might struggle to muster half the number of lighter forces in that of airborne troops are to be on hours notice soldiers are kept on their toes with huge exercises the latest kavkaz caucasus involved personnel and concluded on september th has traded mass for tempo concludes lt general jim hockenhull britain chief of defence intelligence armed forces enjoy the additional advantage of being blooded in battle though and china have comparable weapons the quality of the forces in training and combat experience is night and mr kofman in ukraine for instance has practised armoured warfare and artillery duels experimenting with the of cyber attacks and drones to feed targeting information to its guns syria where over personnel have served has been testbed for precision strikes air defence against rebel drone swarms and the of unmanned vehicles officers in syria have shown signs of shedding the soviet legacy of rigid top down command and acting with more autonomy and creativity practice known as mission command observes mr adamsky that he would be major departure the military tradition and in both countries has honed its skills in electronic warfare by jamming radios radars and drones fake signals in syria were strong enough to bamboozle civilian airliners in israel not everything has been fixed of course viktor murakhovsky former officer who edits military journal is positive about the reforms but he that shipbuilding is slow and that the country lags behind its rivals in range drones the armata tank the next generation su warplane and submarines have all been delayed though is adept at blowing things up in space its ageing fleet of reconnaissance satellites has shrunk over the years with modernisation complicated by western sanctions the biggest problem of all mr kofman is the limited capacity of defence industry shortages of skilled personnel machine tools and components the trade off between hardware and humans is also apparent though troops no_longer go hungry their pay is not great mr murakhovsky points out that skilled tank commander in his can expect little more than rubles month in peacetime lower than the national average in my opinion it not enough morale among conscripts who still up of ground forces remains low and the short duration of their service limits their usefulness in combat though the days of renting out warplanes be over last military prosecutors announced that military officials had been charged with corruption the amount stolen totalled nor has military renaissance bought peace of mind in war with would have conventional superiority for limited period concludes the but would be outgunned if the conflict dragged on in recent years mr putin has therefore worked to ensure that conflict would not drag on he has invested heavily in nuclear forces unveiling host of lurid weapons such as hypersonic gliders radioactive torpedos designed to pollute coastal areas and nuclear powered cruise missiles capable of circling the earth indefinitely missiles like the iskander kalibr and kh can also carry both conventional and nuclear warheads officials point out that they would have no way of knowing which until they landed for generals the hope is that their revived strength means that the nukes are never needed for its has largely focused on threats to the baltic states and the challenges of reinforcing europe over weeks and months it has underestimated how firepower be used in shorter sharper and more expansive war that would stretch far beyond the baltics its planners and the national politicians that set military budgets and

free daily newsletter the economist today published since september to in copyright the economist newspaper limited all rights_reserved reported interference in the and presidential elections is child play compared to its ability to upend our transportation energy financial and communication systems and bring life to halt should this trend continue could become the dominant force on the world stage despite its small army and an the had better wake up the won the cold_war against the soviet bloc in but is losing the cyberwar the economic restructuring humiliated and impoverished of its citizens thanks to demands that it quickly privatize its state enterprises under the leadership of vladimir spy himself chose to deploy low cost high impact and other countries in order to reclaim its role on the world stage any country with decent internet expertise can readily develop and deploy digital power in cyberwars examples include china north_korea saudi arabia and israel in such war there is no for big defense budget or big army and there is no to stockpile arms furthermore cyberwar technology advantage can augment country conventional arms by for example providing it with early warning of an imminent attack the goals and tactics of cyberwars are not different those of the cold_war the main players stayed the same and the or more generally east and west blocs has the relative advantage in this ongoing war between the blocs its can deploy its internet technology and big and numerous social_media platforms to attack the in broad daylight can target any political candidate party and voter group and influence their behavior more accurately than sharp shooter and it could wreck havoc on the financial transportation health and energy systems and bring american lives to halt overall goal is to undermine the democratic way of life in the western world and especially in the it has already demonstrated that it can interfere with american social and political fabrics and sow hatred and divisiveness among its social and political groups and there is plenty of evidence that it has in britain france germany and other countries the must wake up and measured response it must fully acknowledge that this cyberwar is no less dangerous than the cold_war second it must mobilize its technological might help the internet private industry to stop the offensive such an effort already be in place but it must be scaled way up and be given the urgency it deserves third the must mount counterattack against cyberwar infrastructure fourth the must retaliate and interfere with the functioning of society and its foreign_policy eye for an eye byte for byte finally the should consider building coalition with other countries akin to nato which have been invaded digitally by to stop its cyber offensives these measures could also help the blunt conventional successes in the middle_east ukraine eastern europe and the baltic states the has all the expertise needed to these measures but it has not been willing to bite the bullet the won the cold_war so far it losing the cyberwar against this must not happen sponsored the hill street nw suite washington dc tel fax the contents of

coronavirus pandemic under control record numbers of russians are falling ill and dying of the disease every pushing the country health services to breaking point while vladimir_putin has ruled out nationwide lockdown the official daily tally of cases rose above for the on friday when deaths were also reported critics the death toll indicated by tallies of excess deaths could be far higher the increases have mirrored those in european countries such as france and spain but the brunt of the outbreak has been borne by far flung regions that rarely the evening as opposed to the spring outbreak when moscow st_petersburg and the caucasus region were worst affected the rise has been driven by the disease spread across the urals siberia and the border with kazakhstan where colder weather has already driven people indoors the images coming regions have been grisly in the cities of barnaul and novokuznetsk bleak videos have surfaced showing the bodies of coronavirus victims clogging hospital corridors there are bodies everywhere an anonymous videographer in clip regional officials later confirmed the images they they didn have enough pathologists to carry out autopsies so the bodies remained on trolleys and the floors of hospital basement that serves as makeshift morgue ambulance drivers in omsk have complained of hospitals turning them away forcing them to protest with

wednesday that regions were in critical situation with more than of hospital beds occupied five of them were at more than of capacity experts are hesitant to call it second wave they that in most regions the wave never truly receded the in recent weeks however has been extremely alarming it worse than in the months alexey raksha an independent demographer who previously worked for the government statistics agency rosstat he cited rising official tallies past on excess deaths and experimental collated by colleagues that shows an increasing number of internet searches for coronavirus symptoms expecting huge excess mortality in october and unprecedented in november he excess mortality refers to the number of people who die in given period above past average and it is an alternative way to estimate the toll taken by the coronavirus reuters reported last_month that excess mortality in to july was more than triple the official number of coronavirus deaths leaving tens of thousands of deaths unexplained raksha criticised tallies published on the government stopcoronavirus website saying they should be multiplied by four to get clearer picture the country current death toll is but an estimate based on proportion of excess mortality since april would put it between and he agencies have taken steps to block leaks the health ministry has barred employees doctors speaking to the media coordinating with its press office on deaths the regions can months to reach the public civil registration offices had stopped reporting on deaths raksha citing instances in ten regions particularly those hard hit by the virus we something better the official statistics are not up to it the government has defended its conservative methodologies the requirement that coronavirus diagnoses be confirmed by an autopsy the lack of qualified pathologists to perform them is of the official reason for the buildup of bodies in regional hospitals officials lack of morgue space and families slowness to retrieve bodies are also factors has however resisted declaring coronavirus lockdown we not planning sweeping restrictive measures the initiation of so called nationwide lockdown which would lead to practically complete shutdown of the economy and business operations putin at an investment conference on thursday sergei sobyanin the influential mayor of moscow very hope that none of the severe measures being applied in in france germany and other countries be applied here support the report finds that president trump and the republican party are driving online misinformation this election not shady actors on facebook or trolls when it comes to false claims about mail in voting trump twitter account functions as press release who led the team of researchers at harvard universitys trump tweets their way into headlines which are amplified by the republican national committee his campaign staff and the white_house communication team benkler both right_wing outlets and mainstream media have helped trump spread false messages benkler journalists don want to sides or appear biased he so trump outrageous claims are put in headlines with fact check saying they false few paragraphs down in the story in august the researchers started seeing more of the early on this basic desire to grab headline really helped him get his message outside of those inside the propaganda feedback loop and into the more mainstream benkler cornell university study that analyzed million articles about the pandemic found mentions of trump made up nearly of what they call this makes the president the largest driver of falsehoods about the pandemic the world and here in the united_states benkler team finds trump and other republicans are the biggest drivers of falsehoods about voting media outlets have adopted dual track where they report trump claims to look balanced and then go to fact check benkler but what initially reported matters most he nobody reads the fact check except for people who already want to find out that the president is lying he you really do to do the fact checking before the headline is written and the headline and the lead to teach the audience what youre about to hear is false then you can really contain it the york post story on hunter biden serves as an example of how outlets can contain misinformation he robin young brings more than years of broadcast experience to her role as host of here allison hagan is here nows freelance digital producer support the support the war and revolution are not inimical to moscow if they follow paths policymakers understand and support the current unrest in different parts of the former soviet_union it tempting to that is losing control over its neighbourhood and it is true that over some areas its hold has weakened loss of ukraine is undeniable and serious however the current ructions do not mark decline but demonstrate rather the opposite is working on settlements for nagorno_karabakh and belarus and doing so according to its own principles meanwhile the west lacks workable leverage over either issue appear on the foot if misunderstands its aims by assuming that in nagorno_karabakh it stands unconditionally behind armenia its collective security treaty organisation ally whose control of nagorno_karabakh in azerbaijan relies on military support it is also wrong to assume that in belarus moscow stands fully behind alyaksandr lukashenka the authoritarian leader who has declared his friendship towards though not always lived up to it in fact moscow is quite tired of lukashenka faced behaviour and would like to see change in minsk it might also accept some change in nagorno_karabakh as as it happens on moscow terms or at_least on terms understandable to moscow true aim in these neighbourhood conflicts is not to particular sides or personalities but to defend the principles it values it wants to delegitimise bottom up revolutions as means of transferring power it also wants to signal that western interventionism with its promotion of democracy and normative approach are unfruitful in general and unwelcome in particular what is playing out is essentially the same philosophy that guided intervention in syria and if judged against these criteria moscow is doing enough at_least at the moment moscow wants to delegitimise bottom up revolutions as means to arrange transfers of power in belarus for instance moscow might be backing lukashenka for but in reality it is already working on his replacement this process some lukashenka have some over the terms of his exit recent meeting he held with opposition figures in jail was probably of this process svitlana tsikhanouskaya though the opposition_leader based in lithuania and the likely real winner of the rigged election has probably been prescribed the role of bystander by moscow and so has europe the start moscow has shunned all european calls for due procedure respect for human_rights and mediation by the osce vladimir_putin last_week encapsulated his country position though somewhat hypocritically when he did not interfere in what was happening in belarus and we expect no else to interfere either no should be stirring up this conflict to promote their own interests and impose any decisions on the belarusian people nagorno_karabakh is different type of conflict of an ethnic territorial kind and the onslaught of fighting with an azerbaijan emboldened by turkish support might suggest that is facing rival power in its neighbourhood but for in moscow the advantage of having the west out still outweighs the nuisance of having turkey in moscow knows ankara and has learned to work with it the capitals are far being allies their goals in the middle_east often stand in direct opposition to each_other but both realise they each_other as they cannot achieve their aims some acquiescence the other and most importantly the turkish government is motivated by goals that in the kremlin eyes are rational strengthening its power at home enhancing its leverage abroad and pursuing economic and security interests it lacks any western style rule centric approach and instead subscribes to worldview that moscow understands azerbaijan too has pursued its foreign_policy challenging philosophical standpoint or historical narratives though at times it has been at odds with moscow this is why might be more relaxed than expected though its armenian ally is in trouble have reasons to help its ally armenia but it has no reason at all to punish azerbaijan which has been an example of model behavior among the former soviet states as far as is concerned carnegie scholar alexander baunov in nagorno_karabakh it is again moscow that has brought the warring sides together and arranged for ceasefire though an admittedly shaky the western members of the contact group have largely been europeans have tried different ways to influence the situation in belarus lithuania for instance has positioned itself on the moral high ground arranged public shows of solidarity with the belarusian opposition and called for harsh sanctions against the regime france has on dialogue with putin trying to get the latter to accept osce mediation collectively eu leaders made great efforts in august to signal to moscow their restraint and desire not to geopoliticise the conflict in the hope that moscow would mirror the position thus allowing for an armenian style political transition with no geopolitical contest it all to no avail after adopting wait and see position for weeks after the election moscow made up its mind and embarked on strategy of transition that saves some face for lukashenka deepens leverage in the country brings to power leader acceptable to moscow keeps both the west and the osce at arm length and most importantly demonstrates that popular revolution is not an effective way to transfer power can imagine scenarios under which moscow could reconsider its approach change strategy and reach out to the lithuania based opposition but all these would stem developments inside belarus itself such as strikes that paralyse the country or the regime splitting and crumbling rather_than something the west does or the lesson for the west is clear enough to influence post_soviet or any crises needs to have true leverage either on the regional level or on the global level that it can convert to regional influence if relies solely on good principles and the moral high ground it is very easy to be outmanoeuvred

growing fueled by fears chinese investment and resentment at being governed another continent demonstration in support of governor sergei furgal in khabarovsk july khabarovsk the largest city in far_east is known for its classical architecture winter ice sculptures and the country longest running protest for more than hundred consecutive days thousands have taken to the streets waving flags holding pickets and staging marches the protests were sparked in july by the arrest of the region former governor sergei furgal charismatic businessman and local politician furgal scored surprise electoral victory over his predecessor vyacheslav shport the kremlin preferred candidate in in dramatic scenes earlier this he was pulled out of his car and arrested by federal officers who had been flown in directly moscow he stands accused of involvement in series of murders of business rivals in the region in the early the incident has since become focus point for frustrations in the far_east while protestors initially demanded furgal release the moscow jail where he is being held and for his case to be tried locally their chants are more often broad criticisms of both president_vladimir putin and moscow commentators have been quick to speculate that these protests in region where they had previously been unheard of mark the beginning of an organized moderate alternative to putin however the reality is far more complex the liberal democratic party of to which furgal and his allies belong is far that moderate movement in reality it has tended more toward than liberalism calling for expansion into ukraine and belarus in the party representatives in the state duma proposed bill banning the of foreign loanwords which would have fined politicians and the public for using english words when there is alternative the initiative failed to gain support get briefed on the story of the week and developing stories to watch across the asia pacific instead while those taking to the street have vented frustrations at the kremlin their complaints appear to be less about domestic policy than regional autonomy the scion of prominent khabarovsk family furgal local credentials were key to his popular support as protestor pointed out normally the governors are sent to the region moscow but furgal was different he helped us his arrest and the appointment of mikhail degtyarev moscow politician as his interim replacement created narrative that the kremlin was interfering in local affairs afar expansive east beginning at the urals and stretching through siberia to the sea of japan has had an uneasy balance with its western center since the days of imperial its towns and cities have been seen as mere extension of the european nation an asian frontier to be settled and tamed as of the soviet_union mass deportations eastwards and its status as destination for gulag prisoners reinforced that notion but as the protesters in khabarovsk show far_east might be forming its own identity major point of contention is that while eastern holds of the country natural resources oil gas and rare earth metals the proceeds their extraction are widely seen to line pockets in the west rather_than enriching local communities series of environmental catastrophes in the far_east such as petrochemical spill that led to the in october angered locals who feel like they are being left to pick up the pieces while is often stereotyped as ethnically homogeneous percent of siberians are minority ethnic groups and the far_east is home to more than distinct cultures unlike the rest of the country protestant congregations far outnumber those belonging to the moscow based orthodox church in the th century ukrainians were encouraged to settle along the southeastern limits of the far_east the border with china to the sea of okhotsk the scheme was so successful that after the bolshevik revolution of ukrainian majority areas centered on khabarovsk attempted to declare their independence as green ukraine siberian regionalism or as it is known has history but in recent years it has faced source of opposition after the fall of the soviet_union regions enjoyed unprecedented levels of local autonomy with the federal government either too weak or ineffective to impose its on their administrations however since putin has embarked upon to strengthen the vertical power structures leading places like khabarovsk to the kremlin his hand picked governors like the candidate that furgal defeated in have been the linchpins of that plan historically moscow has used the precarious geography of the far_east against those who sought to distance themselves its power with china eastern borders beginning just across the river khabarovsk the threat of expansionism and the for protection was compelling argument against going it alone but china presence in the far_east is being felt in an altogether different way beijing is behind billions of dollars of investment in the region fueling both the stagnating economy but and with the local population media has repeatedly claimed as fact narrative that chinese investment has been accompanied by mass chinese migration to the far_east creating fears that the region is within beijing sights the reality that the has done little to assuage those concerns internet documentary china deadly friend went viral in with claims that chinese tanks could roll into central khabarovsk in under minutes in granting series of concessions to chinese firms moscow has itself become with locals fearing their home is being offered up as raw materials supplier for the people republic of china regional elections in september gave clear sign that those tensions are coming to the fore elsewhere in siberia opposition candidates handed rare defeats to the ruling united party with allies of poisoned opposition politician alexei navalny gaining seats in the central asian cities of tomsk and novosibirsk while navalny blend of ethnic nationalism might have made him an unlikely figure for young russians to unite his prominence as critic of the kremlin made his bloc the de facto choice for protest vote while some in far_east do occasionally speak of an independent united_states of siberia the idea lacks prominent supporters or any realistic prospect of success however the tensions behind it and the growing resistance to being directly governed another continent continue to define relations between center and its extremities for those in far_east moscow might seem like world away with eight zones and five train

hacking group energetic bear is among stealthiest it appears to be casting wide net to find useful targets ahead of the election experts by cybersecurity officials watched with growing alarm in september as state hackers started prowling dozens of american state and local government computer systems just months before the election the act itself did not worry them so officials anticipated that the russians who interfered in the election would be but the actor did the group known to researchers as dragonfly or energetic bear for its hackings of the energy sector was not involved in election hacking but it has in the past five years breached the power grid water treatment facilities and nuclear power plants it also hacked into wi_fi systems at san francisco international airport and at_least other west coast airports in march in an apparent bid to find unidentified traveler demonstration of the hackers power and resolve september intrusions marked the that researchers caught the group unit of federal security service or targeting states and counties the timing of the attacks so close to the election and the potential for disruption set off concern inside private security firms law_enforcement and intelligence_agencies possible explanation is that they are calling in the real pros the team who is used to operating in this really sensitive critical infrastructure where you want to keep quiet until you don suzanne spaulding the former under secretary for cybersecurity and critical infrastructure at the department of homeland_security in hackers other groups were unusually noisy in their efforts to penetrate some state election databases you could argue they didn care about being quiet ms spaulding but that has been called out and punished for interfering in the election president_vladimir putin want to keep this quiet until the circumstances are set for their in information operations she added american officials described the hackings in an advisory on thursday as opportunistic rather_than clear attack on election infrastructure but conceded the group had targeted dozens of state and local systems and stolen at_least targets servers they broadly looking to scan for vulnerabilities and they working christopher krebs the director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency which issued the warning along with the that hardly reassured researchers who have tracked energetic bear for years this appears to be preparatory to ensure access when they decide they it adam meyers the head of threat intelligence at crowdstrike security firm that has monitored the group energetic bear typically casts wide net then zeros in on few high value targets in germany and the united_states the group has infected websites popular in the energy sector downloading malware onto the machines of anyone who visited the sites then searching for employees with access to industrial systems in other attacks it has hijacked the software updates for computers attached to industrial control systems it has also blasted targets with phishing emails in search of employees or co workers who might have access to critical systems at water power and nuclear plants and it has done so with disturbing screenshot in showed the groups hackers with their fingers on the switches of the computers that controlled the industrial systems at power plant the group has thus far stopped short of sabotage but appears to be preparing for some future attack the hackings so unnerved officials that starting in the united_states cyber_command the arm of the pentagon that conducts offensive cyberattacks hit some called the counterattacks the digital era equivalent of mutually assured destruction but any hope that american officials had that their strikes would deter dissipated when the group started targeting american airports in march officials at san francisco international airport discovered state hackers had breached the online system that airport employees and travelers used to gain access to the airport wi_fi the hackers injected code into wi_fi portals that stole visitors user names cracked their passwords and infected their laptops the attack began on march and continued for nearly weeks until it was shut_down by then officials at other airports discovered their wi_fi portals had also been compromised researchers would not name the other victims citing nondisclosure agreements but they were on the west coast as pervasive as the attacks could have been researchers believe hackers were interested only in specific person traveling through the airports that ostensibly hundreds of thousands of people could have been compromised eric chien cybersecurity director at symantec who examined the attack but only were mr chien team discovered that the hackers were fingerprinting the machines of anyone who logged onto the wi_fi network in search of older version of microsoft internet explorer browser if they found match the hackers infected those laptops if the wi_fi visitors used any other browser the hackers left them alone what we could see they were going after specific individual mr chien in the government alert on thursday officials that the group was again targeting aviation systems it did not name the targets but did suggest in some technical language that could have been the airport in columbus ohio in previous homeland_security warning about the group officials it targets low security and small networks to gain access and move laterally to networks of major high value asset owners within the energy sector security researchers warned that the spate of attacks on american state and local systems could mirror the trajectory of those attacks hackers using their foothold in seemingly random victims networks to mine for more interesting targets closer to the election on nov they could steps like pulling offline the databases that verify voters signatures on mail in ballots or given their particular expertise shutting power to key precincts the most disconcerting piece is that it demonstrates intent and ability to target systems near and dear to us but that shouldn surprise us frank cilluffo the director of auburn university mccrary institute for cyber and critical infrastructure security by deputizing the stealthiest infrastructure hackers to target state and local systems some security experts believe be hedging its bets if for example mr putin believes president trump be elected and wants to forge better relationship with the united_states he want to limit the degree to which is seen as interfering likewise the experts if former vice_president joseph biden jr the democratic nominee is elected try to its foothold in the systems to weaken or delegitimize him or it hold so as not to provoke the administration by doing this more quietly you give yourself more options ms spaulding advertisement sections tv featured more nbc follow nbc washington intelligence and cybersecurity officials they see no sign that hackers have tried to infiltrate the election infrastructure the way they did in when all states were probed and voter rolls in some states were accessed officials also that when it comes to cyber defenses this is but those same officials acknowledge that there is no way to protect every state county and precinct network infiltration by hackers and that the russians or another foreign power could still decide to mount cyber offensive to disrupt the election experts this is unlikely because it would mean crossing red line that could provoke serious reaction the government and they it would be extremely difficult for hackers to actually change vote_tallies but if an adversary decided to attack here are the ways experts the russians or less likely or the chinese could cyber techniques to cause an election nightmare imagine an infrastructure attack maybe in some key precincts or states swing states for the election where maybe power goes out or maybe the service goes out frank figliuzzi the fbi former chief and an nbc contributor or you cant your credit card or pump gas just something that sows discord and confusion officials have the russians have planted cyber bombs on american power grids and communications networks to be triggered at later date if desired perhaps the most ruthless and effective way the russians could disrupt the election would be to shut_down the power or the cellphone service in few critical areas making it impossible to vote this is perhaps the most frightening scenario but also the least likely because such an attack could be considered an act of war and the might feel compelled to retaliate not just with cyberattack but also military response as the recent spate of attacks on hospitals has shown ransomware is devastating method of cyberattack that is extremely hard to stop all it takes is computer user clicking on malicious link thereby opening network to malware that encrypts all the and turns computers into bricks unless ransom is paid to unlock it the ransomware attacks against hospitals are being carried out by speaking eastern european criminal group experts but nothing prevents the government deploying similar group the state often works with criminal hackers officials to attack american elections recent ransomware attack against local government systems in hall county georgia has slowed the election department capacity to count absentee ballots officials there have voting machines themselves aren connected to the internet but ransomware attacks against county or precinct could shut_down critical supporting networks that could it difficult to conduct the election in swing state the impact could be huge weve seen an increase in the of ransomware by folks who maybe couldnt write it themselves but its available out on the black market and they can buy it matt drake former fbi election threats specialist with defense contractor saic and its certainly concerning that if it were launched shortly before the elections it could be difficult for some places to overcome that on primary in some voters showed up to the polls in riverside county california only to learn that their voter_registration information had been changed online their party affiliation had been switched and they couldn vote in their preferred primary baffled voters insisted they hadn made the changes the local district attorney concluded the voter rolls had been hacked and if they had chosen to do so could have tampered on large enough scale to seriously disrupt the election they they haven detected hacks of voter rolls this cycle but that doesn mean there haven been any or won be imagine if the russians or some other adversary deleted every third voter_registration record in three pennsylvania counties and voters showed up only to be turned away in knox county tennessee during mayoral primary officials distributed denial of service or ddos attack shut_down county website publishing election results the county had to mail out the official tallies the actual vote was not affected but some members of the public weren able to see the results on election night in presidential_election the associated_press and other organizations deploy reporters all over the country to eyeball official results and send them in so it would be difficult for hackers to blind the country to most of the results large media companies have strategies to defend against ddos attacks but reporters can be everywhere if these attacks which are easy to carry out were deployed against local governments on large scale the country experts they could disrupt and delay the dissemination of some election results and undermine confidence in the vote the most plausible threat and other adversaries this election season is not physical hack but mental experts the russians and to lesser extent the chinese and the iranians are ready to deploy english language disinformation on social_media that is designed to exacerbate any dispute about the vote count and any protest in the election aftermath these disinformation networks are designed to small incident such as few mishandled ballots and amplify it in way that allows side or the other to cry fraud term for this is perception hack foreign adversaries don have to do experts because extremists on the far left and the far right have shown themselves all too eager to traffic in conspiracy theories that spread like virus through social_media if the election results are disputed current and former intelligence officials told nbc they worry the russians dust off playbook they intended to employ if donald_trump lost narrowly to hillary clinton in drumbeat of disinformation designed to sow doubts about the results in for this reason the fbi and the department of homeland_security cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency have repeatedly warned americans to twice before passing along unverified information about supposed election irregularities but in terms of their reach those warnings can hardly compete with the giant bullhorn commanded by trump who has repeatedly and

before bric turned into brics following south africa accession the five brics countries together represent over billion people or about percent of the world population published on by on october prime_minister atal bihari vajpayee and president_vladimir putin cemented india bilateral ties with the signing of the historical agreement the decades since the signing of the agreement bilateral_relations are hailed to have chartered levels of cooperation amid fast changing regional and global scenarios while shouldering mutual interests and concerns the strategic_partnership has been at the cusp of litmus test as it has endured events such as the terrorist attack colour revolutions the georgian war the economic depression in the mumbai attack the crimean referendum and its aftermath and the current covid pandemic it is therefore worth reflecting on the decades of seemingly positive bilateral engagement between india and it is important to analyse how the agreement signed in has played role in the continuum of ensuring the mutual understanding peaceful cooperation and reliability between the strategic partners this is also an opportunity to critically evaluate the magnitude of our strategic relationship and the changes in the foreign_policy priorities since given the current global context the key question is how prepared are india and for insulating the strategic_partnership amid the challenges in the post pandemic world the declaration of strategic_partnership was signed at when the momentum in the bilateral_relations between india and post_soviet collapse had fatigued due to several factors but the most crucial factor of them all was the renewal of the the renewed treaty had almost written off the bilateral engagement as clarified that it was no_longer willing to any defence commitment during the of any external military threat to india key security clause article ix that constituted the very core of the indo soviet treaty the strategic_partnership treaty signed in gave lease of life as it restored india relations to respectable levels both the countries realised the to develop multifaceted bilateral cooperation in all possible spheres of defence energy space nuclear science and technology etc india strategic_partnership with since then has been unique intense and substantive in ways mainly the treaty led to the of high level political interactions through annual bilateral summits key feature of the agreement to foster extensive collaboration and dynamism in the partnership the twenty annual bilateral summits held so far between india and have in particular seen major agreements and initiatives undertaken to strengthen the partnership to higher levels additionally in the bilateral ties were further elevated with the signing of the arguably the partnership between the countries has been successfully reflected in instances at regional and global platforms general assembly referendum against for its accession of crimea in and unequivocal support to india on the kashmir issue are few cases in point regarding strategic_partnership in sensitive spheres of cooperation between india and defence cooperation continues to be of the major boosters for engagement between the countries india has acknowledged contribution in assisting the former in military power projection and preserving its national_security interests although in recent times there is downgrading in the purchase of defence equipment by india the cooperation in this sphere has been unassailable given that it has progressed buyer seller relations to joint research development and production high end technology transfer that has encouraged india quest for indigenous defence capabilities the induction of ins vikramaditya to the joint production of brahmos missile india defence cooperation has achieved capacities through acquisitions and joint development in fact resurgence as military power in recent times is conducive to india domestic initiatives such as the in india project the finalising of the despite the threat of imposition of caatsa sanctions has shown india predictable resistance to external pressures given its historical ties with indo nuclear cooperation constitutes an important element of our strategic_partnership the kudankulam nuclear power plant knpp has become of the biggest success stories of india cooperation as unit and unit start commercial operation the process for reactor buildings of units and have already begun with the construction of nuclear power plants planned india nuclear cooperation has indeed reached heights india and bangladesh signed trilateral agreement in march for the construction of npp in rooppur bangladesh has been another major element of the strategic_partnership since an export oriented energy country aim to leverage its energy card with india an import oriented energy market india interests in the arctic for instance especially energy resources are crucial aspect for india growing energy security needs this is seen as great step towards strengthening india energy cooperation the bilateral partnership which has global strategic connotation has seen both the countries promote the idea of building multipolar world order and changing the global financial structure in this regard both india and have envisaged promoting harmonious global order based on international law and collective decision making that includes developing countries and is not monopolised by developed countries alone india and along with other players such as china have succeeded in establishing non western organisations such as brics and sco the member states have within their capabilities and limitations established mechanisms that address economic and strategic interests such as the development bank while brics and sco have become tools of political signalling on issues related to global affairs there however exist asymmetries among the member states with regard to economic growth performance distribution of resources and military strength additionally although china is member of such multilateral organisations at the individual level beijing has exercised assertive posturing that has caused concern in india this can be seen by its irrational border claims and actions in the indian ocean region the role of especially during the of crisis between india and china is therefore anticipated to be non partisan and meaningful when the treaty of strategic_partnership was signed in the world was at the brink of war on terrorism after the terrorist attacks on the world trade centre both india and at their respective level joined the bandwagon on the global war on terror both parties as bilateral partners which have been victims of terrorist attacks voiced their interests and concerns in combating terrorism and related activities india and have therefore cooperated at bilateral and multilateral levels for instance india and also share the mutual interest of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their possible acquisition by terrorist groups while both india and assert their distinctive identity in world politics respectively the strategic_partnership has seen close coordination of foreign_policy interests to wide range of international and regional issues both countries firmly believe that intensification of the indo strategic_partnership can help respond to the challenges thrown up by global changes in more effective way while both india and have diverging approach on the indo pacific narrative cannot deny that the countries understand the for in accordance with the universally accepted principles of international law this includes combating piracy at sea and providing humanitarian aid during natural disasters the countries have shown keen interest in restoring peace and stability in afghanistan eurasian integration has been key priority in the india strategic_partnership understands that in its quest for greater eurasia india is vital player for its huge market potential economic growth performance military strength and enhanced position in international affairs strategic_partnership in between india and since the soviet_era and has continued to remain today in fact both countries have agreed to expand their relations in the aerospace sphere an area of traditional cooperation for decades more than joint projects involving scientists and research institutes both countries have been undertaken within the framework of various initiatives since while critically evaluating the decades of strategic_partnership between india and it is tempting to compare india strategic_partnership with other major global players and the strategic_partnership that it shares with the realities of the dynamic nature of international relations have definitely posed challenge to the partnership the pursuing of an all alignment foreign_policy has caused certain level of discomfort in the bilateral_relations india growing proximity with the and compromised defence cooperation with china and mending of ties with pakistan in recent times has caused anxiety in the strategic_partnership between india and possible inference that can draw is the constant comparison to the current india partnership with that of the nostalgia of indo soviet ties but needs to bear in mind that compared to the strategic_partnership that both india and share with other major players there are limitations and shrouded with lack of trust india defence relations with for instance is yet to any substantive development in joint production and restrictiveness about its technology compared to generosity to sharing defence technology and relations with pakistan is eclipsed with lack of trust and understanding as for china relations there is growing speculation of possible role reversal in the partnership given china growth in global politics in recent times however there are few stumbling blocks in india defence cooperation especially the shifting trends in partnership for example defence engagement between and china current cooperation with china has emerged exclusively as it includes cooperation in sensitive fields such as strategic missile defence hypersonic technology and the construction of nuclear submarines with allowing for the latter to be equipped with similar and more advanced capabilities china is major security concern for india hence given the way collaboration in advanced future weapon systems quantum technology and artificial intelligence should be enhanced further between india and indo relations are undoubtedly at the cusp of litmus test nonetheless the strategic_partnership should see the future of asia beyond the and china factors and both india and can play decisive role in promoting their mutual interests in the region the rapid and uncontrollable spread of covid in the past seven months has impacted the global order and the interconnected systems reflecting the spirit of the partnership in times of crisis also welcomed india goodwill gesture to send medical supplies to help fight the virus critics have often pointed out that the strategic_partnership is yet to achieve its full potential given the fact that some of the spheres of cooperation continue to be remain obsolete for instance the economic relations additionally given nearly years of diplomatic relations soft power capabilities cultural diplomacy academic exchange programmes and labour migration are at an imperceptible status trade and investment remains the weakest link in our strategic_partnership and falls far short of our potential which unfortunately is not commensurate with our high level political cooperation post the announcement of the strategic agreement in which largely promotes the strengthening of economic relations between india and the trade cart received required upgrade potential areas of trade have been explored which include trade and investment energy nuclear science and technology pharmaceuticals it steel diamonds fertilizers infrastructure heavy engineering and food products exploring economic prosperity sustainable development and free movement of people information knowledge ideas and greater institutional links has also become crucial in fact both countries have set target of in each_other country by the it is also heartening that options are being explored to further expand the domain of economic cooperation eurasian integrity regional cooperation free trade agreements connectivity and trade corridors have gained the utmost importance in the annual bilateral summits in the past decades the countries have also set up mechanisms such as commissions for example irigc tec the international north south transport corridor and the eurasian economic union which have emerged as immediate priority areas for strong economic cooperation between the countries the far_east is another region for potential economic engagement india presence in the eastern economic forum eef is aimed at developing trade commerce investment railway infrastructure steel plants defence space ports and shipping india has successfully participated in the annual eef with prime_minister for the development of the far_east other than these developments our economic ties are focused on exploring the potential of sub regional cooperation sub regional cooperation has emerged as of the prospective areas of cooperation and regional connectivity to add further impetus to the economic cooperation between india and the key goal is to cement and cooperation between the states and union territories of the republic of india and provinces of the federation to further bolster india far ambitions an of four indian states led by the commerce and industry minister of india piyush goyal visited vladivostok to explore the opportunities and potential of business to business cooperation in the far with the introduction of the in the world the for both india and to tap the potentials of agricultural sector is crucial regional connectivity needs due attention hence the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors such as chennai vladivostok needs prompt engagement the major impact of the pandemic has prompted countries to explore alternate market destinations and shifts in the business environment the crisis has opened opportunities for countries such as india and to reposition themselves in the global supply chain with its efforts to attract investment to the far_east and india with its huge manpower and existing available manufacturing units should be endorsed as potential and suitable alternatives for manufacturing instead of developed nations despite the seemingly successful bilateral_relations between india and the strategic community is incomplete if there is shortfall in establishing strong people to people engagement since the soviet_collapse bilateral_relations have seen minimal cultural diplomacy academic exchange and labour migration perhaps vistas of cooperation could be explored to promote soft power capabilities between the countries such as cinema which has always been of the most successful foreign_policy tools to enhance cultural exchange and people to people contact between countries the film industry is great medium for spreading narratives and in india movies have an immense following as as impact on the minds of the population india and collaborated in movie production during the soviet_era however the trend did not last due to the fall of the soviet_union among other factors the is right for both india and to collaborate in the entertainment industry especially through joint production of movies and creating powerful narratives related to bilateral cooperation india and must concentrate more on the content of the movie rather_than joint production alone as for the audience the content matters more than the producer moreover it can have an everlasting impact on the minds of the indian population if the content projects character aiding collaborating with an indian protagonist in movie in bringing down an antagonist also the indian movie industry is always on the look for exotic locations in foreign lands hence in order to attract the indian movie industry could look into easing travel and other shooting permissions within its jurisdictions such an effort would not only bring closer industry ties but also be able to showcase the and its rich culture to the indian population thereby acting as window of promotion for tourism regarding geopolitical realignment today the global community is seeking pragmatic the role of india and is crucial in their efforts to diffuse the multipolar world system this is also relevant for regional alliances to actively engage politically and economically which should help bilateral_relations between the countries elevate to higher pedestal in post pandemic world order the current global situation has given rise to some daunting challenges for the partnership once again some of the are linked to the disruptions being caused to the international order by traditional and non traditional threats such as climate change secure communication challenges etc nurturing hopes for stability and prosperity in eurasia in the post pandemic world bilateral_relations between india and and their proactive role in regional mechanisms such as sco eurasian economic union eaeu and india china ric are viewed as an integral of this construct regional connectivity needs due attention the successful execution of alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors in conclusion the signing of the milestone agreement in was the outcome of developments that took place in bilateral_relations between india and after the fall of the soviet_union the main aim of the agreement was to elevate the partnership to level of cooperation and put speculations and uncertainties in the relationship to rest over the past twenty years of relations the partnership has seen ups and downs nonetheless this has not allowed any major damage that could impact or lead to any serious conflict of interest between the countries having that the coveted relations built over the years cannot be taken for granted in this regard apart political elites and bureaucrats playing crucial role in enhancing the relations academicians artists students the research community tanks and educational institutions should contribute to forming the true essence of the partnership the youth in particular to draw inspiration each_other rich history and cultural relevance carrying forward the vision for term partnership the engagement of both countries in the international ecosystem in the post pandemic world has become more relevant as it has given rise to challenges and opportunities the strategic_partnership between india and nevertheless needs to insulate the mutual interests challenges that emerge within and external factors perhaps the for reality check and serious introspection be crucial as the challenges are only set to grow given the dynamism of international relations our partner published on by despite its large population of billion which have considered as an impediment china domestic economic reforms and collaborative strategic diplomacy with external countries have made it attain superpower status over the united_states while united_states influence is rapidly fading away china has indeed taken up both the challenges and unique opportunities to strengthen especially its economic muscles on october vladimir_putin took via videoconference in the final plenary session of the annual meeting of the valdai international discussion club the valdai discussion club was established in with goal is to promote dialogue between and international intellectual elite and to an independent unbiased scientific analysis of political economic and social events in and the rest of the world putin touched on wide range of different issues what particularly interesting was his assessment of the changing politics and the economy and rating of the global superpower the world has changed several times meanwhile increasingly and insistently makes us question what lies ahead for humanity he during his interactive speech with the participants in effect the post war world order was established by three victorious countries the soviet_union the united_states and great britain the role of britain has changed since then the soviet_union no_longer exists while some try to dismiss altogether according to putin indeed the soviet_union is no_longer there but there is in terms of its economic weight and political influence china is moving quickly towards superpower status germany is moving in the same direction and the federal republic of germany has become an important player in international cooperation at the same the roles of great britain and france in international affairs has undergone significant changes he further explained the united_states which at some point absolutely dominated the international stage can hardly claim exceptionality any longer generally speaking does the united_states this exceptionalism he asked rhetorically and further cited that powerhouses such as brazil south africa and some other countries have become more influential in the world amid the current fragmentation of international affairs there are challenges that require more than just the combined capacity of few states very influential ones problems of this magnitude which do exist require global attention international stability security fighting terrorism and solving urgent regional conflicts are certainly among them as are promoting global economic development combating poverty and expanding cooperation in healthcare that last is especially relevant today arguably china has worked on all that is recorded as its grandiose achievements it has systematically transformed its economy at the same maintained the political structure its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions it brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history china reduced extreme poverty by million as expected of any development process there are still problems nonetheless the level of public support for the government and its management of the country is high with of chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government according to survey that compared with putin explained that has to begin the scratch lenin spoke about the birthmarks of capitalism he reminded and added that it cannot be that we have lived these past years in full fledged market economy in fact we are only gradually building it and its institutions had to do it the ground up starting clean slate of course we are doing this taking into consideration developments the world after all after almost hundred years of state planned economy transitioning to market economy is not easy on other way round it is necessary to closer look at in fact complete insight into the approach economic capability and the services by the chinese china has such diverse landscape with investment and trade the world according to the world bank china has the largest economy and of the world foremost infrastructural giants china is the world and of goods china holds of the world total wealth the second largest share held by any country it has the world largest banking sector with assets of trillion and the world top largest banks all being in china in china overtook the us as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world according to the global wealth report by credit suisse it has the highest number of rich people in the world top of wealth since there were chinese billionaires and million millionaires china belt and road initiative has expanded significantly over the last six years and as of april includes countries and international organization along with brazil india and south africa china is member of the brics group of emerging major economies in recent years the country has significantly strengthened bilateral ties with asian countries such as china and india with latin american countries an important aspect of relations with the west is the criticism of political system and over human_rights on the other hand putin leadership over the return of order stability and progress has won him widespread admiration after the united_states the european union and other countries imposed economic sanctions after the annexation of crimea and collapse in oil prices the proportion of middle class could decrease drastically the population moves forth and has to support its economy with increasing population since the government started simplifying immigration laws and launched state program for providing assistance to voluntary immigration of ethnic russians former

this month president trumps national_security adviser robert obrien held with his counterpart nikolai patrushev the men met in neutral switzerland as patrushev confidant of president_vladimir putin is under sanctions by and of the reasons went to meet with gen patrushev is to let him that there would be absolutely no tolerance for any interference with our election he he demanded that not engage in that sort of thing the russians have committed to doing so despite patrushevs commitment and obriens apparent acceptance of it intelligence_agencies is still trying to interfere last_month fbi

joe_biden shakes hands with vladimir_putin then russias prime_minister in moscow in vice_president joe_biden shakes hands with vladimir_putin then russias prime_minister in moscow in the kremlin has categorically denied interfering in any elections past or present but the kremlin also recognizes that the issue has become an obstacle to improving bilateral_relations slightly little more than week after wrays testimony an agreement that would ban interference in the other countrys electoral processes the initiative echoed putins proposal to form which he floated during his summit with trump in finland and went nowhere the kremlin is sticking to the line that it is in fact the united_states that tries to interfere in politics three years_ago the federation council the upper house of the parliament formed temporary commission on foreign interference in it called temporary because we hope that the come when you won interfere with us andrei klimov the commission chairman tells npr if we the commission permanent it would mean you going to constantly interfere with us we still want to believe in the good klimov his commission has accumulated thousands of pages of documentation of influence efforts he claims american foundations connected to the government work with political activists and that cyberattacks on originating in the united_states are manyfold those in the other direction the notion of interference was bogeyman he invented during the obama administration to try to help hillary clinton win the white_house in in moscow the acrimony left over the last presidential_election is real everything was supposed to be so different when donald_trump unexpectedly took over the presidency barack_obama promising to improve relations with what followed instead were continuing charges of malfeasance by trumps own intelligence officials and bipartisan support in congress for tightening sanctions with about three months left in trumps term relations are more fraught than when he came into office the last major arms_control treaty between the united_states and expire in february and negotiations continue to extend it on state televisions barometer of the kremlins mood anchor dmitry kiselyov used the presidential debate to criticize america as whole anyone who watched the contentious debate was left with feeling of disgust kiselyov for decades america has imposed its way of life on the world as universal model he and everything has changed so fast trump once celebrated as friend of is no_longer seen so favorably according to only of russians have positive view of trump while have negative and of respondents they were hearing about biden for the very the kremlin of course knows biden very the very fact that biden was obama vice_president already makes him not friendly figure in moscow based political analyst masha lipman obama looked down on in some of his statements he certainly sounded not respectful this caused this sense of offense on as the obama administration pursued reset in relations with the kremlin biden made saying in that it had withering economy and was clinging to something in the past that was not sustainable on visit to moscow in the president is in his fourth term and looking ahead to more looking into your eyes and don you have soul to which putin in biden rendering smiled and replied we understand another three years later when troops seized ukrainian territory biden became obamas point man on ukraine still putin knows biden could become the next american president asked by tv reporter last_week about his preferences putin tried to be diplomatic we work with any future president of the united_states with the person who have the trust of the american people he we that president trump has repeatedly spoken in favor of developing american relations we certainly appreciate that very he he blamed bipartisan consensus on the necessity of containing for limiting trump room for maneuver at the same putin criticized the trump administration for signing off on sanctions and for withdrawing the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty last as for biden putin the democratic candidate used sharp anti rhetoric but that the kremlin was encouraged by biden interest in preserving the start arms_control treaty originally negotiated by the obama administration that expires in february lipman cautions that the prospects for better relations are bleak no matter who wins if biden becomes president he consolidate european allies against moscow she while if trump is reelected his political opponents pursue an harsher policy toward the only thing that helps the kremlin lipman is more polarization and turmoil in the united_states turmoil means the united_states weakened she this is what the kremlin can actually benefit not an improvement in relations this is the only thing that hope for npr thanks our sponsors watch cbsn live cbs in this episode of host michael morell interviews general mcmaster senior_fellow at both stanford universitys hoover institution and its graduate school of business career army officer and national_security adviser to president trump he is also the author of his newly released book titled battlegrounds the fight to defend the free world general mcmaster passes along advice on how the next president should handle relations with north koreas kim jong un gives his insights on the effectiveness of our handling of and shares his passion for helping those in venezuela michael_morrell general mcmaster welcome to intelligence matters it is an honor to have you on the show gen_mcmaster hey michael the honors mine is great to be with you michael_morrell let me start with couple of points for our listeners want to congratulate you on your book ive read it its terrific its must read for anyone interested in national_security and actually see it as reference book for understanding the key issues and see myself pulling it down off the shelf to when im thinking about something want to have to talk about something when im writing something its very important contribution to the literature on the threats and challenges we face as nation so thank_you thank_you very for writing it gen_mcmaster michael thanks so mean it somebody with your background experience and knowledge to to endorse it like that that means lot to me that you judge it to have been worthwhile thank_you michael_morrell second having you with us to talk about your book is perfect way for us to kick off what is for us going to be series on the key national_security issues facing the united_states the series which were going to work very hard to be nonpartisan run between the and the inauguration and finally should mention to my listeners that this episode is going to run the after the election but that you and are taping it the friday before the election so you and have no idea whats going to happen on election so people should just that as theyre as theyre listening to our conversation and thats actually good thing for our conversation because what want to do at the end of the is get your sense of what is going to face the president who is sworn in on january th no matter who that person happens to be michael_morrell before we get to the individual issues that want to walk through with you id love to ask you why you decided to write the book that you did you obviously could have written very different kind of book and im sure that there were publishers who were encouraging you to do that but you chose not to do that you chose to write very serious look at the threats and challenges that face us as nation why did you the route that you did gen_mcmaster michael thank_you served in the army for thirty four_years so as transitioned to what is my only second career in my adult life made out probably quite predictably mission statement for myself and that was in my second career to try to deepen our understanding of the most crucial challenges we face as way to better inform the american people about foreign_policy and national_security issues and with the hope that if we learn more about these challenges that we face we can demand better demand better foreign_policy our elected leaders but then also hope that the book and the work that im doing the book help bring americans together right because dont any of these issues should be partisan in nature what im hoping for is that deeper understanding of these challenges we face and what should be our common commitment to try to build better future for generations to come help bring our country together at_least foreign_policy and national_security issues michael_morrell what are the main themes of the book what do you want readers to walk away remembering gen_mcmaster what are the themes that runs through the book is this idea of strategic narcissism this is of the reasons why our competence our ability to compete at_least in the post cold_war period has been significantly diminished and by strategic narcissism mean our tendency to define the world only in relation to us and then to assume that what we decide to do or decide not to do is decisive to achieving favorable outcome and of course you michael with your experience with intelligence this is flawed because its self referential and it doesnt acknowledge you the degree to which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future so the book is then an argument an argument for cultivating with my friend and great historian zachary shore has termed strategic empathy and this is an effort an effort to understand better what drives and constrains the other especially adversaries rivals and enemies and what drives and constrains the other often times is ideology and emotion and aspirations so the theme in the book that also is important is an effort to understand how the recent past produced the present as the step in making projection into the future so the book is an argument for the understanding of history and appreciation for the complex causality of events and focus on understanding these crucial challenges were facing the perspective the perspective of others michael_morrell you thats of the thats of the main jobs of the intelligence community right is to is to give our decision makers the point of view of the other guy the guy sitting across the table you the guy sitting across the battlefield you but whats the other guy thinking what are his constraints what are his interests and thats extraordinarily important right gen_mcmaster of course its not idea it goes to sun tzu but its we started to neglect the importance of this especially in the post cold_war period period that describe as period of over optimism over optimism that led to complacency and bit of hubris and this over optimism was in large measure set up set of for significant disappointments in the thousands disappointments of course associated with the mass murder attacks of september th but also the unanticipated length and difficulty of wars in afghanistan and in iraq and of course followed by financial crisis and so it was in the thousands that this emotional impetus behind our foreign_policy shifted overoptimism to pessimism and maybe tendency to under appreciate the risks and costs of action to tendency to underappreciate the risks and costs of inaction and that strategic narcissism is the cause really in both cases michael_morrell you the other thing that strikes me when you talk about the importance of history is always thought sitting in deputies meetings that it would have been incredibly valuable to actually few minutes and every deputies meetings or principals meetings to talk about the history of the issue just to review how you got point to point and we never did that in multiple administrations in which served but always thought that that would have been really valuable gen_mcmaster michael youre absolutely right about that ill tell you of the of the great gifts had before earlier my career was the opportunity to read things study and write history and the book wrote was which is story about how and why vietnam became an american war and of the lessons learned the study of that history was that it was important to understand problems and challenges holistically before leaping into action when came in as national_security adviser did my best to at_least avoid making the same mistakes and we put in place principle small group framing session thats mouthful but as we developed these strategies for the most crucial challenges we were facing we began with this framing session that was organized five page paper that included only really the description of the challenge how we got to where we are bit of the history of it and then an inventory of our vital interests that were at stake view of that challenge through the lens of those vital interests and draft overarching goals and more specific objectives followed by assumptions assumptions about the degree to which we and like minded partners have agency or influence over this challenge then an inventory of obstacles to progress and opportunities that we could exploit and thats it then we had discussion about the nature of the challenge the policy coordinating committee which you are the real workers who are going to work on this project theyre listening in so theyre getting theyre hearing at the cabinet level discussion about the nature of the problem and then refinement of it once that of the meeting was done then we shifted to discussion of what are your ideas how do we integrate the elements of national power and efforts of like minded partners to overcome these obstacles and exploit these opportunities then they got to hear the treasury secretary what we have we have economic and financial tools available but those ought to be combined with diplomacy and maybe law_enforcement efforts and then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with so that hope thats process that be sustained dont my successor hung onto it it have to be resurrected at some point if it is deemed as useful by future national_security adviser michael_morrell im michael_morrell today we have with us mcmaster senior_fellow at both stanford universitys hoover institution and its graduate school of business career army officer and national_security adviser to president trump ok so what id love to do is go through the individual issues and what id like to do is just throw out get you to frame it whats the threat or challenge that we face whats the history how did we get here whats our interest thats at stake and how do you we as nation to go about dealing with it lets start with the big lets start with the big enchilada china gen_mcmaster china is great example of strategic narcissism at work and especially this assumption that we clung to for too that china having been welcomed into the international order would play by the rules would liberalize its economy and as it prospered it would liberalize its form of government of course thats not true thats not true because we undervalue the degree to which emotions and ideology drive and constrain the chinese communist_party and what would argue in battlegrounds is that the party is driven mainly by fear fear of losing its exclusive grip on power and an associated ambition the ambition to achieve national rejuvenation for china to center stage in the world again after the tragedy as they portrayed as the century of humiliation it is that combination of fear and aspiration that is driving the partys effort to extend and tighten its exclusive grip on power internally this is why there are over million people in concentration camps in xinjiang and theres campaign of cultural genocide ongoing this is why the party is extending their repressive arm to hong kong and perfecting their technologically enabled orwellian surveillance police state this is what were seeing and then what is more troubling is the parties effort to export its authoritarian mercantilist model through number of strategies that aim to create servile relationships with countries and then ultimately through economic means as as the growth in the peoples liberation armys capabilities to establish areas of privacy across the pacific region that exclude the united_states and then it challenged the united_states in the free world globally if china succeeds mean our world be less free less prosperous and less safe so the stakes are high and its past for us to recognize the to compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form of aggression that the parties engaged in michael_morrell what would an effective china strategy look like to you gen_mcmaster the trump administration if it gets credit for anything should get credit for fundamental shift in our policy toward china that was overdue and that is fundamentally sound and this is the idea that we have to compete and it was under the strategy of of cooperation and engagement that the chinese communist_party was emboldened competition doesnt to lead to confrontation in fact quite the opposite and we have returned to arenas of competition involving countering more effectively chinas campaign of sustained industrial espionage against us countering range of chinas unfair trade and economic practices doing so in large measure through effective international cooperation for example establishing better standards for infrastructure investment internationally the law_enforcement actions and investigations that have gone on against apt the main hacking arm of the chinese communist_party have been very effective as combined with sanctions and other actions against the aggressive arms of the party but really the most important thing for us to do and argue this in chapter battlegrounds entitled turning weakness into strength is to what the chinese communist_party sees as sources of weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strengths what does the party fear the party fears that the people the chinese people might want to have in how theyre governed so we should strengthen our democratic processes the party fears rule of law we should strengthen rule of law in the united_states and with countries that are working to strengthen rule of law in their countries the party fears freedom of press freedom of the expression we to strengthen our authoritative sources of information and recognize that investigative journalism is great counter to some of these pernicious strategies that the parties are pursuing so that of it is defensive but of it is more introspective and trying to maintain our competitive advantages michael_morrell this is intelligence matters im michael_morrell were talking with former national_security adviser mcmaster so how do you about gen_mcmaster is significant threat to us because putin again is examining the assumptions of previous policies putin is not going to become like the grinch on christmas eve right his heart is not going to get too big as the size gets bigger and hes not going to decide ok maybe the future of does lie more with the west and treat the united_states and europe and others differently putin is driven by sense of honor lost after the breakup of the soviet_union he is also driven by this associated desire to restore to national greatness hes also cognizant though of the fact that he cannot compete with this on our own terms and so what his theory of victory is is to drag us all down and then to be the last man standing and the means that hes using to do this describe the chinese approach of cooption coercion and concealment and alliteration in the chapters as it is campaign of disruption disinformation and denial to try to disrupt us to disrupt our effective governance to disrupt us economically and to economic coercion when he can such as he has done in europe effectively to and with energy dependence then to deny his most egregious acts especially the sustained campaign of cyber enabled information warfare against us which is designed to polarize us to pit us against each_other to reduce our confidence in who we are as people and in our democratic institutions and principles and processes is dangerous threat for for these reasons and the best way to counter the step is to pull the curtain on this activity to educate ourselves about it to be less susceptible to information to not be our own worst enemies as both political parties in instances have because they compromise and they compromised our principles to score some partisan political points and in doing so themselves vulnerable to disinformation and propaganda michael_morrell then what about raising the cost to him of doing this is that an option here in terms of deterring him gen_mcmaster absolutely this is what advocated for in battlegrounds is that we have to impose costs on the kremlin on putin that exceed those that he factors in at the beginning of his decision making process it was my last really in an oval office meeting it was the that president trump decided to impose significant costs on in response to the attempted poisoning murder of sergei skripal and his daughter with with banned military grade nerve agent and an act that put thousands of uk citizens at risk and it was at that on that occasion that we expelled you over undeclared intelligence agents that hits putin where it matters because these are agents that were critical to his sustained campaign of subversion against us and we impose significant costs additional costs on through sanctions and other actions the closing of the san francisco consulate as you michael was major intelligence collection platform for the russians here in silicon valley and the bay area so that was significant and that sent strong message after navalnys poisoning id like to see us do the same thing you and as hes infiltrating more little green men into belarus and as he continues to enable the serial episodes of mass homicide that is the syrian civil war to support hawthornes way perpetuating violence in libya michael_morrell im michael morell were talking with mcmaster former national_security adviser to president trump and author of the just published book by the way if you missed any of todays show you can listen to it as podcast just search wherever you get your podcasts lets talk about north_korea give us your sense on north_korea gen_mcmaster thanks michael of course its important for us to recognize going in right that north_korea is the only communist hereditary dictatorship in the world and it is the nature of the kim family regime that we have to into account when were considering the danger that the regime poses to the world if it does possess the most destructive weapons on earth the kim family regime is driven mainly by this drive to remain in power it is of course known as the hermit kingdom it is gulag state that fears any kind of opening to the world and it is regime that across three generations of dictators has been committed to unifying the korean peninsula under the so called red banner and as we look at north koreas pursuit of the most destructive weapons on earth we have to be at_least open to the possibility that it wants those weapons to coerce the united_states off the peninsula as the step in the forcible reunification of the peninsula and of course that would that would be the form of destructive war gen_mcmaster its also important for us to recognize that it is highly unlikely that north_korea wants nuclear weapons just to deter us north_korea already had very significant deterrence capability with its conventional weapons and the fact that its so thousands of artillery pieces are within the range of of seoul south korea and then also its important to recognize that every act of aggression on the korean peninsula since the north invaded the south in june of has been initiated by the north the other aspect of this problem michael that is very important to consider is that if north_korea gets the weapon is recognized as as nuclear power like who doesnt get after that right this japan starts to have conversation with south korea by the way north_korea never met weapon it didnt try to sell to somebody excluding its nuclear program until the israeli defense force bombed that facility in so its very dangerous its dangerous as because of the ideology that drives this regime its warped ideology this is the zushi ideology which has turned deprivation into sign of virtue and racial superiority and the north korean people have gone through generations of brainwashing so this is big problem michael that the approach that is in place the strategy of maximum pressure its the best course of action we have to test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince kim jong un that he is safer the weapons than he is with them it be important for whoever is sworn in on january th that they recognize that we should not repeat the failed pattern of previous efforts not allow north_korea to draw us into negotiations with an act of aggression and with the demands of big payoff up front just for the privilege of talking with them to not again engage in drawn out negotiations that delivers weak agreement that he immediately breaks again michael_morrell youve something here that is really important because the conventional wisdom is that he wants these weapons for deterrence right that hes worried about us attacking him but youre arguing that its more than that that this gets to the heart of what north_korea has always wanted which is to reunify the peninsula which is really important point here that changes how you about how you have to deal with him gen_mcmaster this is an argument michael for strategic empathy right to view these complex challenges the perspective of the other and unless you do that youre susceptible to mirror imaging and of course my research for the book you that sensitized me to this it was in the run up to the vietnam war where some of those who were planning the vietnam strategy development the strategy actually referred to the reasonable man theory of english common law and assumed that ho chi minh would respond as the theoretical reasonable man would respond taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played in driving and constraining the north vietnamese leadership michael_morrell do you at the end of the its possible to convince him that he would be better off that he would be more secure these weapons gen_mcmaster do its possible and the reason its possible because weve never really put maximum pressure on the north and so we have this opportunity thanks really to the tremendous work by ambassador nikki haley when she was at the as you michael these security council sanctions on north_korea are unprecedented and reach the key though is to enforce them of course the key country that needs to enforce them is china and if china doesnt enforce them if china continues to be complicit with illicit financial flows into and out of the country to continue to provide energy and other materials to the north that are limited by these sanctions then its for us to consider secondary sanctions and maybe on chinese financial institutions gen_mcmaster as we see the smuggling of coal and the transshipment of coal and oil and fuel that under article the president could article authority to interdict those ships as you michael this is something we cant really talk about there are other means of putting pressure on the north that we havent done it yet we have to at_least test the thesis because the alternatives are so bleak of either accepting north_korea as nuclear power and coping with that threat or war right that would be very costly its worth pursuing michael_morrell we still have more to discuss with general mcmaster and be right with our final segment michael_morrell were with more intelligence matters im michael_morrell our guest is mcmaster senior_fellow at both stanford universitys hoover institution and its graduate school of business so sir let me ask you about another tough iran gen_mcmaster on iran what tell the story of in michael is we have to view the problem of iran with fundamental considerations foremost in our minds the is the ideology of the revolution and how that drives iranian leadership and the iranian leadership is the supreme leader and the guardian council and the islamic revolutionary guards corps we have this fantasy that the reformers the republicans within iraq are going to prevail they lost the revolutionaries are in charge the hardliners are in charge and whenever they put this forward the shop window of minister zarif their foreign minister or president rouhani thats all youre getting is the shop window that ideology is it drives the iranian regime to continue its four decade proxy_war against the great satan the united_states the little satan israel the arab monarchies and the west broadly and so we have to consider the ideology of the regime and and this proxy_war gen_mcmaster what argue for in the book is to force the iranian regime to choice you can either be treated like normal nation or you can continue to wage this proxy_war to support terrorist organizations and keep the middle_east enmeshed in this perpetual state of sectarian civil war the choice is yours and to impose that choice what we should not do is lift the arms embargo to the regime what we should not do is lift any of the sanctions in fact we should impose the costs on the regime to constrain the resources they have available to continue their proxy wars against us but then also ultimately maybe to convince the iranian people that they ought to have government in place and im not talking about like regime change but government in place that shifts away its permanent hostility to the united_states israel and the west thats the only path that see forward our policies ought to aim to effect that change in the regimes permanent hostility and until it does any agreement with them it cant be trusted and any agreement with them that allows them to escape making that choice like the iran nuclear deal did is to our disadvantage michael_morrell so you dont see the regime changing policy on its own do you that has to be forced internally by the iranian people is that fair gen_mcmaster michael on iran its important to keep considerations in mind in crafting strategy toward iran of all that its the ideology of the regime that drives their hostile behavior toward us and we have to recognize that its the supreme leader its the guardian council its islamic revolutionary guards corps who are in charge right there was struggle you across the history of iran since the revolution in between the republicans and the revolutionaries hey the revolutionaries won and and we have to recognize that the second consideration is that this regime has waged four decade proxy_war against the great satan us the little satan israel the arab monarchies and the west generally we have to craft our strategy in recognition of this regimes permanent hostility to us of course the best way to approach it in the title of the chapter in is forcing the regime to choice of either being responsible nation and then being treated as such or suffering the consequences and this is why its very important to keep the arms embargo in place its very important to keep the sanctions in place on the regime to in the short term reduce the resources it has available to wage this proxy_war and in the term hopefully convince the iranian people to demand change in the nature of the government such that it ceases as permanent hostility michael_morrell okay islamic extremism its waned bit in the threat but its still there west africa to the middle_east to south asia to southeast asia how do you about that problem term gen_mcmaster the reason that we havent had another attack on the scale of the most devastating terrorist attack in history of september th is our tremendous intelligence professionals our diplomats our military whos been engaged against this threat jihadist terrorist organizations since what im concerned about michael is that these groups are more dangerous today than they were maybe on september th and thats because of course those who committed the mass murder attacks against us on were the mujahideen alumni of the resistance to the soviet occupation of afghanistan the al qaida alumni the isis alumni the lashkar taiba alumni are orders of magnitude greater and they have access to more and more destructive capabilities and the reason weve been safe is because weve been engaged and we have this narrative of ending endless wars and disengaging what americans to is that we are engaged so we can enable others to bear the brunt of this fight mean this disengagement afghanistan is tragedy the way that weve gone about this we should recognize the sacrifices of our longest war and in particular that of our courageous servicemen soldiers gave their lives for our country our security this but we have to also recognize that afghan soldiers and police die defending the freedoms that theyve enjoyed since the defeat of the taliban in removal of the taliban power so that we to sustained argument to the american people for engagement with this problem of jihadist terrorism because if we dont michael go to remember when we after the embassy bombings we fired few cruise missiles and called it right that didnt work out michael_morrell the last issue want to ask you about is venezuela which you care about my understanding is that when you arrived at the white_house you were going over the issues and you kind of stumbled on venezuela and hey you whats going on there that doesnt look like were paying attention to this talk about venezuela and why its important gen_mcmaster its immensely important because this is humanitarian catastrophe in venezuela its humanitarian catastrophe thats brought on by an authoritarian regime that is denying the venezuelan people in how theyre governed when we looked at the problem and the nature of the maduro regime and the chavista movement we concluded that this was again corrupt government that is using criminalized patronage networks to effect control of its people it uses these motorcycle gangs and militias to overwhelm any kind of opposition it ended the constitution so we whats should our goal be our goal should be to work with others to work with like minded countries to effect restoration of constitutional rule in venezuela and to do that we felt as if we had to pursue three objectives of those objectives would be to try to strengthen the opposition right to help the opposition come together you saw that with the rise of bolsonaro you who was really the people you hes not member of the caracas polo club for example hes somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged so significantly under chavez and maduro gen_mcmaster the second objective would be for the people to be able to attribute their grievances to the government not to blame the yankees you for example and the third related to that would be to try to galvanize really popular support for restoration of constitutional government the measures we put in place were sound of course they have proven inadequate and we thought that economic sanctions would maybe have significant effect but the reason they havent had bigger effect is theres huge black market illicit economy thats run by maduro he uses that to sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gangs of thugs who really prevent any real opposition gaining traction but im proud of what we did in this period of we worked very closely with partners especially in the western hemisphere mexico under the foreign minister of the great luis videgaray who was wonderful partner took leading role in of the work that we did we tryd to get the organization of american states and others to do more but it was really the community of like minded nations brazil colombia peru panama argentina we worked very closely together on this problem and remain committed to trying to effect restoration of constitutional government in venezuela michael_morrell youve been fantastic with your just want to ask you more questions we have couple of minutes left so to be quick here michael_morrell the is that in order to deal with all of these problems that youve talked about you we healthy national_security toolkit healthy diplomacy healthy intelligence capabilities healthy military capabilities whats your assessment sort of overall of where we are with our national_security toolkit gen_mcmaster were in good shape thanks to the extremely dedicated civil servants and military professionals intelligence professionals who we have across our government but what is needed more than anything is higher degree of what argue in is strategic competence and thats the ability to integrate the elements of national power so that theyre applied in way that are synergistic the whole is greater than the sum of the parts at times we get it right but most often we get it wrong and our approach to these complex problems is fragmented its inconsistent its as mentioned you based on flawed assumptions about the nature of the problem what would like to see as these days is more of concerted effort to foster multinational cooperation as write in mean none of these problems are solvable by any country so its very important for us to create the right venues for us to come together not only to work on discrete issue or event together but really to about these complex challenges to frame them together and then to apply our competitive advantages between our like minded countries so that we do have synergistic effect and and so that we can build better future for generations to come michael_morrell the last question anybody whos listened to the podcast up to this point is going to wow that is hard tough list wonder at the end of the if youre optimistic or if you are pessimistic that were going to get this right going forward gen_mcmaster michael im optimistic about it im optimistic about it as we emerge this triple crisis of the pandemic the recession associated with it and the divides in our society laid bare by george floyds murder and the protests and civil unrest that followed it whats great about our democracy is we are self correcting the american people have in how theyre governed they can demand better and the reason wrote is if the american people understand these challenges they demand better foreign_policy our elected leaders you our founders knew that our democracy was going to require continuous nurturing its still true today and believe that we do have significant problems at home but we also have to confront these challenges abroad because we the covid pandemic that problems that develop abroad can only be dealt with at an exorbitant price once they reach our shores so the argument of battlegrounds is an argument for sustained engagement with the world michael_morrell the book is the author is mcmaster general thank_you very for joining us today gen_mcmaster michael thank_you for the privilege of being with you and thanks for your service be in the get the latest breaking delivered straight to your_inbox copyright cbs interactive inc all rights_reserved advertisement_supported by nonfiction when you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site we earn an affiliate commission by by mcmaster on his morning as president trump national_security adviser in mcmaster invited me to drop by his office he had heard that the york times was getting ready to report on that attempted to sabotage north_korea missile programs with cyberstrikes is this the revelation of the modern enigma codes he asked the military historian searching for an analogy the world war ii operation to crack german ciphers it was bracing start for what turned out to be wild month effort to devise modern security strategy for president with no experience more interest in cutting deals than designing term strategy and an unwillingness to sit for intelligence briefings less discussion of containing an angry decaying or of plan to compete with rising china so battlegrounds is at its heart the mcmaster strategic plan that might have come to fruition had he worked for president who was interested in strategic plans before he walked into the west wing mcmaster was the closest thing the army had to soldier scholar his book about vietnam was devastating account of how the united_states had flawed decision making process that was largely based on self deception in ways battlegrounds is the sequel seeking to ask the question of why not whether the united_states at another moment of protests in the streets and bitter partisan divides is losing its ability to shape the world but the answers this are different in mcmaster view the key to his argument is that america is suffering what hans morgenthau called strategic narcissism or in mcmaster words the tendency to view the world only in relation to the united_states and to assume that the future course of events depends primarily on decisions or plans it hard to argue with that premise every president comes to office assuming that the world is waiting for direction washington some countries are others are looking for power vacuums they can fill each in its own way that been the story of the past decades has emerged as disrupter knowing that it has neither the money nor the technology to the united_states on directly china has become builder why threaten to cut undersea cables as vladimir_putin submarine force does if you can dominate global communications as rob joyce an official who worked for mcmaster as the white_house cybersecurity coordinator is the hurricane china is climate change mcmaster realized that and devoted of his in the west wing to writing national_security strategy that would reorient the united_states away nearly decades of and toward countering moscow and beijing which he called revisionist powers it was an impressive document unfortunately the president under whose name it was published aides concede did not read it battlegrounds expands on the written strategy the the white_house has barely mentioned since it was published and makes strong case for containing pushing on chinese influence and using american leverage and allies to confront iran and north_korea what washington needs mcmaster argues is an integrated approach that recognizes that the old tools that drove saddam hussein out of kuwait in when mcmaster served are pretty useless years later he starts with the united_states and europe were ill prepared for toxic combination of disinformation denial dependence and disruptive technologies he recognition that what happened in was not that america radar was off it that the radar was never built fortunately it has since been pieced together and in the presidential contest everyone facebook to twitter to the united_states cyber_command has been pushing disinformation has been blocked clumsily at_least briefly unfortunately mcmaster boss was not on board with this approach in mcmaster he notes president trump often improving relations with would be good thing not bad thing while succumbing to putin flattery and treating his criminal actions with dismissiveness and moral equivalency and of course the repeated references to the hoax which meant no in the president circle could discuss election interference dreading an eruption triggered by trump fear that the legitimacy of the election was being questioned mcmaster never deals head on with the fundamental problem that the administration had on paper defensible strategy and the president kept undermining it instead he cites his top aide fiona hill who he writes always warned that putin seeks to divide americans and europeans should not divide themselves china the climate changer is of course immune to containment strategies if the old cold_war was largely military contest version is military diplomatic economic and technological contest that change led to misappraisal of the challenge as mcmaster points out succession of administrations convinced themselves that over china would conform to western built system trump succumbed to different illusion that the chinese were all dealmakers like the property developers he knew crucial to mcmaster analysis is china strategy to wire together its own collection of allies and dependent powers selling them controlled in china technology huawei networks to after mcmaster departed tiktok addictive app it took the united_states decade and half to understand the immensity of the trojan horse it had let in he of how the united_states blindly let chinese giant gain ground while american firms exited the market but the reader yearns for mcmaster solution ban chinese technology maybe president trump is trying but then china dominate percent or more of the world networks embrace an industrial policy that win the market it is in dealing with the biggest failures of the trump administration iran and north_korea that mcmaster sounds the loudest alarms while he was major critic of president obama nuclear deal with tehran and criticizes obama aides for overlooking iran support of terrorism and terrorist regimes he reports that internally he argued for staying inside the deal and using trump threats to toss it aside as leverage but the president wouldn that chess moves ahead and dispensed with the whole deal month after mcmaster left he fears that the united_states allies to confront iran slip into the place we are with other nuclear powers that washington once declared could never possess nuclear arms pakistan provides stark warning iran could become like pakistan today nuclear armed state in which terrorists already enjoy support base the greatest threat to humanity in the coming decades lie at the nexus between terrorists and the most destructive weapons on earth north_korea of course already has those weapons and lot more fuel for them than when the trump administration arrived with its threats of fire and fury if they were not turned over immediately it was the president ego that got in the way mcmaster knew he that as soon as kim jong un proposed summit the president would find historic meeting between north korean leader and president irresistible not single weapon or missile has been dismantled but the sanctions regime is in tatters undercut by and china which takes me to mcmaster question his are we facing the modern enigma codes it turns out the enigma this is us americans want the unrivaled power the global influence and the economic growth and freedom that come with it the kind we enjoyed with little

bid for world championships could also stop for four_years the case formally pits wada against its affiliate known as rusada the agency was ruled non compliant last december that decision and is being disputed but it is the state that is effectively on trial for its handling of the database it was given to wada investigators belatedly in january after the laboratory had been sealed wada details of

tank rand released last_month which explains that political and military leaders are already concerned about nato advantage in the air domain worry that is likely to worsen as the number of fifth_generation aircraft grows to the west at heart of texas air show there are seven european nato nations that operate or plan to buy the belgium denmark italy the netherlands and norway poland and uk by those militaries ought to collectively own more than examples of the stealth fighter this exceed the number of us fifth_generation aircraft stationed in the european theater by wide margin the report the combined force of possessed by european allies is likely to approach aircraft by and would represent roughly percent of the combined fleet for its plans to acquire examples of sukhoi su fifth_generation fighter jet by moscow recently the such stealth aircraft would be delivered by december european allied air forces have fourth_generation fighters comprising types such as the dassault rafale eurofighter typhoon and lockheed martin the combined force currently has less than fielded according to rand those fourth_generation aircraft would be vulnerable in high intensity conflict against country with robust surface to air missile defences during the opening phases of conflict with vulnerability to advanced ground based threats would constrain the roles of most fourth_generation and so called fourth_generation plus platforms the report as as an extensive integrated air defence threat persisted more advanced platforms such as the rafale or eurofighter could theoretically perform strike missions inside the threat zone in conjunction with fifth_generation platforms although this approach could yield unacceptable attrition but with fourth_generation fighters likely still to up of european nato air forces by the alliance needs to find ways to better of the aircraft the fast jets could be used to launch range missile strikes beyond the range of surface to air missiles and if upgraded with active electronically scanned array aesa radars european fourth_generation fighters would be more capable on defence aesa radars can detect track and identify more targets faster and at longer distances notes rand the resultant situational awareness and ability to defeat multiple threats at the same makes an aesa capability essential for aspects of high intensity operations for example to intercept cruise missiles the tank report the french decision to procure aesa for the rafale fighter is informed by the opportunity to provide increase in detection range of low observable targets and maximize the value of weapon systems such as the meteor beyond visual range missile the mbda meteor is an active radar guided beyond visual range air to air missile that is reported to have reach of nm km in theory if fourth_generation fighter like the rafale has an aesa radar and is armed with beyond visual range missile like the meteor it ought to be able to see and hit incoming aircraft while staying out of reach itself however beside the addition of aesa on the rafales other european fourth_generation aircraft lack the advanced radar uncertainties remain as to which nations invest in aesa radar technology advanced and range munitions and secure communication links among other important capabilities rand the degree to which european air forces acquire these technologies directly impact their ability to contribute to the range of combat air missions expected in high intensity conflict for its the uk royal air force announced in september plans to add the ecrs mk aesa radar to examples of its tranche production standard typhoons with initial operational capability targeted for ultimately to the most of mixed fleet of fourth and fifth_generation aircraft nato to invest in communications technologies to link the jets as as training exercises to practice coordinating the combat aircraft can communicate among themselves with their multifunction advanced link madl low probability of intercept communications link rand points to fourth and fifth_generation fighter operating concept called combat intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr mode described by justin bronk of the royal united services institute tank in the combat isr mode four ship flight of connected by madl generates situational awareness and shares targeting with legacy platforms that can then fire their payloads outside the range of the most capable of the enemy air defences explains rand the fourth and fifth_generation combat aircraft would communicate and pass targeting information with the link system adds the report however this might be vulnerability point it is reasonable to assume that the military would seek to disrupt this synergy during conflict particularly in light of recent investments in ew capabilities rand still european nato militaries are getting more practice with the already allies have undertaken initial steps to establish common tactics techniques and procedures for incorporating fifth_generation assets into combined operations through targeted exercises as as preliminary synthetic training systems that link fourth and fifth_generation aircraft the tank of the highest hurdles to nato collaboration might be investment in aircraft readiness to be operationally relevant during theatre conflict nato air forces must maintain sufficient number of available aircraft munitions and aircrew rand currently most european air forces maintain half of their existing fleets or less at mission capable status with some allies falling below that mark what more fourth_generation aircraft are suffering rising maintenance costs platform age operational wear and tear resulting high operational tempo and challenges associated with spare parts pipelines serve as significant constraints to aircraft availability the report the also has teething problems its autonomic logistics information system support system that is so troubled that it has to be replaced across the worldwide fleet rand recommends number of solutions to nato aircraft readiness problems making public on mission capable rates it also suggests public agreement by nato leaders on standard availability objectives could provide renewed political and budgetary focus on efficient and adequately funded maintenance and sustainment ultimately rand concludes that the growing number of stealth aircraft in europe means the trend lines lead in the right direction with additional budgetary and policy

future of cybersecurity negotiations at the united nations by october as covid has wrought worldwide disruption so too has it affected the un open ended working group oewg on cybersecurity the only forum open to all un member states for deliberating how to promote peaceful and stable cyberspace because the pandemic prevented its final in person meeting the oewg missed its mandated july deadline for consensus report containing agreements on norms international law and other leading global cybersecurity issues more on the oewg has since been pdf its final substantive in person meeting is tentatively scheduled for march after online summer sessions another virtual session september to october set the oewg rolling again proposed format for the future but the late september meeting also marked the debut of novel pair of conflicting resolutions the united_states and although the draft resolutions have been circulated among un member states neither are yet final nor public the proposed resolution calls on states to wait until the current group of governmental experts gge and oewg meetings are completed in early before formally proposing process to address cyber issues at the un in contrast the draft resolution calls for oewg to be convened despite the fact that the current oewg has not yet finished its work the resolution would also reaffirm the right of states to combat the dissemination of false or distorted and recognize states duty to refrain any defamatory campaign for interfering in other states domestic affairs the clashing resolutions risk repeating when parallel resolutions both_sides were adopted in creating the oewg while renewing the longstanding gge the push for and extended oewg seems especially given proposed pdf poa format for un cybersecurity deliberations which is currently under discussion in the oewg released for discussion on october by france and egypt the proposed poa has quickly gained the support of diverse range of at_least forty countries with several others all african union member states also rumored to be leaning toward endorsement recently by french scholars and analyzed in an informal pdf it seeks to replace the dual track discussions of the gge oewg with single permanent un forum however the push for and extended oewg raises doubts as to whether the call for poa can achieve consensus support which it needs in order to be endorsed in the final oewg report if so the poa could potentially be put to the un general assembly as resolution later on perhaps incorporated into future resolution in this case the poa initially pitched to eliminate the redundancy of the parallel un cyber processes could simply emerge as replacement to the gge while existing alongside an extended oewg such dual track scenario would run contrary to the objectives of the poa and could substantially reduce its effectiveness more on draft resolution follows recent trend of behavior widely seen as unproductive over this past summer informal online oewg sessions were marked by antics friday evening surprise on june when delegation unilaterally announced an eleventh hour veto of the secretariat pdf to prolong the oewg mandate the announcement momentarily lurched the oewg process into uncertainty as it meant the oewg would have to conclude by its original july deadline and was followed by fiery pdf by at june informal meeting which excoriated the existing oewg draft report bluster soon subsided though and later accepted plan to reschedule the final oewg session such behavior the delegation combined with its premature resolution calling for five oewg to study how to move forward rather_than to work with an existing widely supported proposal like the poa raises questions about the extent to which seeks meaningful outcomes the oewg the old oewg which unlike the gge is open to all countries has enabled some countries to actively participate and share their national positions in the deliberations since its pdf that it is to translate norms on paper into norms in practice yet after of discussion it is unclear how more can be agreed among states beyond the existing agreements such as on norms and the

leftovers for the rest of the world later if at all the united_states for example has secured advance purchase commitments for over million doses of at_least six candidate vaccines all for itself compounding an image of selfishness the trump administration confirmed last_month that it would not join an effort by dozens of countries to provide for the pooled procurement and equitable distribution of vaccines this decision has created the political space for to cultivate the role of benefactor though it too has not joined the covax effort is pitching dozens of countries licensing and production offers for sputnik these deals aren limited to obvious friends and neighbors like and pending regulatory approval at_least million doses and more buy million and mexico has purchase agreement for all told is claiming preliminary applications totaling we don yet the terms of these arrangements and the pending regulatory approval clause is important the deals might break down if sputnik safety and efficacy don pan out though is trying to quell these fears by for adverse reactions if you the head of mexico or the philippines or brazil reeling months of medical social and economic shock you might be willing to your chances on an incompletely tested and probably relatively cheap product that you can get your hands on soon especially if it looks like the united_states and europe are leaving you to go it alone mr putin only rival for the role of global savior is which is also rushing across regulatory milestones for vaccines and pushing deals like to help latin american and caribbean countries pay for them china has also just joined covax though the kremlin is engaged in pandemic related belt tightening just like everyone else it carrying little debt and has billion in liquid assets in its sovereign wealth fund it can afford some measure of vaccine generosity the image burnishing would be worth the price sputnik is also fodder for disinformation campaign on state_controlled media the claim is that only the vaccine is safe and effective has history dating to soviet times of health related disinformation the kgb planted fake stories the world in the early was an american biological weapon research has shown that trolls and bots have actively tried to in vaccines in the united_states since at_least for the sputnik vaccine goes far beyond national pride mr putin needs showy win after slew of recent bad press he resorting to his standard playbook leveraging weak hand and exploiting missteps and vulnerabilities unilateralism neglect or abandonment of key allies retreat established science to bolster image and global position as great power is betting that its short term diplomatic gains outweigh the longer term reputational risk should problems arise with the sputnik vaccine the united_states could counter gambit and contribute to an important global public good by making relatively modest investment in the covax vaccine

regardless of the election result moscow continue to see us policies as provisional as of temporary phase that needs to wait out to see what follows in early the european council on foreign relations organised discussion on in washington with the intention of comparing european and american views on the country and finding out whether there was transatlantic rift in our approaches and indeed there was rift but it was not transatlantic instead it ran between participants european as as american who that must be pressured into accepting the rules based world order and others who asked what rules based order where do you see it this rift become more pronounced and acquire importance should joe_biden win the us presidential_election his victory would almost certainly lead to renewed attempts to engage in transatlantic cooperation on several policy areas or maybe starting with but while modicum of transatlantic unity and coordination would undoubtedly be good the vision that guides it matter great deal any transatlantic policy needs to be based on realities attempts to recreate the past to restore the international order of the or that of would likely prove not just futile but in chaotic world where order is not yet available needs to tread carefully and avoid overplaying weakened hand while still quietly working on the contours of the future europe has three competing theories on how to approach but all of them are rendered ineffective by the absence of global order to give them structure the difficulty of coming up with workable approach to is reflected in europe policies these days europe has three competing theories on how to approach but all of them are rendered ineffective by the absence of global order to give them structure the let call it the lithuanian theory to reflect the country recent activism on belarus though it is shared by in northern and eastern europe consists of doubling down on the moral high ground rooted in the end of history thinking of the this policy seeks to influence through criticism it emphasises conditionality treats dialogue as reward and resorts to symbolic acts such as public displays of solidarity with pro democracy forces and of course crafted speeches competing with it is the french theory embodied by president emmanuel macron attempts at outreach to this is rooted in classical realpolitik balancing the notion that to avoid being crushed between the united_states and china europe needs to engage in some rapprochement with regardless of our normative differences and moscow weak democratic credentials in to politics this view is expressed in efforts to come round to europe or sometimes just france position and lingering somewhat sadly on the sidelines there is the german theory rooted in what academics would label liberal interdependence and confirmed by germany experience of unification this theory assumes that cooperation and dialogue eliminate differences and lead to normative convergence germany theory was dealt an early blow in when vladimir_putin return to the presidency showed that normative convergence had not happened and it largely crashed after invasion of ukraine in still up until last summer germany has been looking for topics on which it could engage with in the hopes that keeping the lines of communication open would have some good effects and help the world safer place none of these approaches has worked recently this is because in world in flux moscow sees them all as fleeting theoretical constructs that are not fit to invest in let alone build on policymakers dismiss the lithuanian theory as fantasy based on past dreams moscow does not believe in the normative framework that forms its basis and if it did would fight against it the french theory goes nowhere because moscow does understand who macron speaks for himself france or europe moscow sees his ideas as unrealistic and domestically driven and in any case has no intention of limiting its freedom of action by prematurely siding with europe especially given that it does not whether the european union become policy actor to reckon with or if it is here to stay scepticism about europe also explain the dismal fate of the german theory moscow has recently allowed its disputes with berlin to pile up in ways that cost it its best european friend apparently just because it does not care to save or invest in relationship with germany and by implication europe the us election result affect the relative standing of these theories biden win might embolden the lithuanian theory put the french theory on the defensive and depending on the circumstances lend energy to germany attempts to create patches of common ground in the west otherwise normatively adversarial relationship with not to be confused with appeasement which is different thing entirely proponents of each theory would seek to strengthen it by coordinating and cooperating with biden administration and they would want to help the president succeed using their favoured approach which would be different trump but so moscow would likely remain reluctant to buy into any of this this is not to that it does not matter to who wins the us election moscow does not have great expectations regarding either president but the outcome nonetheless have an impact on view on the direction the world is heading in second trump presidency would validate what according to some experts has always been putin world view instinctively he is nationalist unilateralist and transactional analyst in december for him this is how the world works and he wants to be vindicated he wants to be able to tell the west he has always been right biden win would clash with this view it would show the kremlin that the normative ideas that have underpinned the western policies are not dead that they might comeback and importantly adapt to realities but adaptation cannot be taken for granted and would inevitably so in either case moscow continue to see us policies as provisional as of temporary phase that needs to wait out to see what follows moscow would view trump as destroyer of the liberal system and would welcome this but not as an architect of system that it could engage with and moscow would inevitably suspect biden presidency of being just the last gasp of the former liberal consensus the more biden urged restoration of obama era policies not to mention those of the clinton era the more moscow would see his actions as the death throes of dying order and as such something to resist or ignore conversely the stronger biden proved in acknowledging that the world had changed and that western policy needed to change too the more seriously moscow would him as figure who could shape the future the task is to find way of shaping the world influencing in the circumstances where the western unipolar moment of the has passed and years of relative western hegemony might be drawing to close this takes humility caution and clear head emotionally driven policies and rushed solutions do not fit in seminal study exploring the lessons that the soviet_collapse might offer to the european union ivan krastev that in times of threats of disintegration political actors should bet on flexibility and constrain their natural urge for rigidity and solutions intended to last which if and when they fail can accelerate the momentum to disintegration this applies to the disintegration of the international order as attempts to forcefully recreate yesterday order almost certainly lead to its final discreditation efforts to build something forcefully and prematurely be stillborn fruitful policy requires humble mindset and an understanding that to shape the world order the west needs to start at home by making its own

maximum of vehicles nowhere near enough to meet the demand during games in response the city council provided number of other sites that took parking capacity up to vehicles and bicycles however no sooner had problem been solved than another was created how were drivers and cyclists supposed to find their way to the car parks solution was found in the shape of small blue panels with white

disability russias monetary policy decision makers are preparing for continued uncertainty and wave of coronavirus cases sweeping of the world urging caution as its central bank there is some wiggle room for further interest rate reductions we see some room for the reduction it is limited it not so as it was before but we decide how and when to this room according to incoming central bank chief elvira nabiullina told cnbc geoff cutmore on wednesday referring to the country interest rates in both its september and october meetings russias central bank chose to keep its key rate steady at total reduction of basis points since june of the previous nabiullinas emphasis was on being cautious she we made pause in september and october assessing the short term inflationary risks and some risks related to financial stability the market that why we we should be more careful about the development of the situation with the pandemic with geopolitical issues and other issues nabiullina still considers the bias in interest rates to be to the downside if she is being cautious because the covid escalation in autumn increases the disinflationary risks and the risks for the demand and we see that in medium term perspective the disinflationary risks prevail of course she and we that our policy remain through the end of next we that instead of decisions of cutting rates that we have made before it last through the end of this at_least nabiullina recovery for economy in the third quarter was very dynamic and led by domestic goods consumption but the resurgence of coronavirus cases in of the world has forced the country to revise down its forecast for consumer and investor demand key of that lies in demand for of most lucrative exports oil which saw historic drop this spring and is still trading at more than below pre pandemic levels due to weak demand the autumn covid escalation has led to some slowdown in the recovery and that is why we revised our forecast for this only plus half percentage point and we expect this the economy contract by between and nabiullina that figure is still not as bad as that of the world bank which that economy could contract by for we brought down our forecast for the next we the growth be between and and be led by the internal consumption she the world bank in its june outlook for also pointed to household consumption as being expected to lead the recovery still it highlighted risks that nabiullina stressed on wednesday concerning not only the pandemic but geopolitical uncertainty and its impact on oil prices the world bank forecasts that with potential positive growth gross domestic product levels in still struggle to match pre pandemic levels has the fourth highest number of reported coronavirus cases in the world at

business and financial stock quotes and market and analysis also provided by washington ap in donald_trump campaign chairman with an associate suspected of ties to intelligence another trump associate sought inside information about the candidate himself for his opponent emails then tried once he entered the white_house these were among the findings of the special counsel investigation of ties between and trump campaign it produced trove of damaging or at_least embarrassing information about trump yet in the campaign democrats are largely ignoring the probe it republicans who are making it top campaign issue trump and his supporters have cast the investigation as witch hunt it refrain in trump tweets and speeches and on conservative media in the run up to the election trump appointed officials are ordering the of documents that trump hopes boost his campaign while some of the revelations the steady drip of newly declassified documents are serious they do not undercut the reasons the probe was launched or its principal findings an inspector general and bipartisan senate panel have both concluded that the probe was valid look at the probe why was the investigation launched the fbi opened crossfire hurricane on july after learning trump campaign aide have had advance knowledge that intelligence operatives had stolen democratic emails diplomat revealed that the aide george papadopoulos had boasted to him that he had heard had damaging information on democrat hillary clinton that it could release to harm her campaign that conversation triggered alarms within the fbi since the hacking operation which resulted in the public disclosure of thousands of hacked emails was not yet public knowledge what did the investigation find the investigation was taken over by special counsel robert mueller whose team documented substantial contacts between trump associates and that included with lawyer that trump oldest son donald_trump jr took with the expectation of receiving dirt on clinton and campaign chairman paul manafort who shared internal polling with contact whom characterized as intelligence officer separate justice department inspector general report was opened for valid reason and did not find evidence of partisan bias the senate committee report found manafort contacts posed grave risk was trump vindicated he was not criminally charged but he wasn vindicated it is true mueller his investigation did not find sufficient evidence to establish criminal conspiracy between trump or his associates and to sway the election but the investigation also described broad interference as as campaign that was eager to receive the help and expected to benefit it mueller also investigated multiple episodes in which he found trump tried to exert control over the investigation by firing his fbi director but mueller did not push forward with obstruction of justice charges citing justice department policy against indicting sitting president what are the criticisms of the investigation most focus on strand the fbi suspicion that former campaign adviser carter page was agent page has denied that and was not charged with any wrongdoing the inspector general identified major errors and omissions in applications the fbi submitted to secretive court for permission to eavesdrop on page for instance the fbi failed to update the court as it received information that undercut its original premise about page it also highlighted how the warrant applications relied in on democratic funded research conducted by former british spy christopher steele the problems are significant because they suggest the fbi misused intrusive surveillance powers or withheld information the court the fbi was alerted of research and key source for steele was himself once investigated by the fbi for possible connections to intelligence newly declassified documents show multiple former fbi and justice department officials the applications had they then what they fbi director chris wray has issued to prevent the problems recurring but the page aspect of the probe accounted for only fraction of it and the dossier though the target of derision had nothing to do with the decision to open the investigation the page problems don relate to the criminal convictions that mueller team produced against six trump associates or the russians indicted on charges related to election interference how are republicans weaponizing it in an extraordinary mix of politics in america national_security apparatus trump has demanded that intelligence and justice department officials act to discredit the investigation before the nov election to large extent they ve complied of the declassified material involves page and the dossier but they ve also released information that while creating buzz in conservative media offer scant evidence of wrongdoing officials declassified the names of obama administration officials of an american in this case former national_security adviser michael flynn who surveillance revealed had interacted with ambassador but who wasn identified by name in intelligence reports while trump cast the unmasking as sinister it routine action and proper procedures were followed the washington post reported tuesday that probe commissioned by barr and focused on the unmasking question had concluded criminal charges or any findings of substantive wrongdoing separately some republican senators are seeking an inspector general investigation after records showed multiple members of mueller team had forgotten their work phone passcodes or entered the wrong ones too often causing to be lost of the prosecutors andrew weissmann has in media interviews that the issue is overblown since the information was backed up more recently the national intelligence director john ratcliffe trump loyalist declassified what he was intelligence analysis though he acknowledged the information might not be accurate meanwhile attorney general william barr has appointed prosecutor to investigate the origins of the probe that prosecutor attorney john durham of connecticut has former fbi lawyer for altering an email related to page surveillance trump has demanded big name indictments and called for the probe to be but it not clear when durham finish his work or what it reveal how is the probe figuring in the presidential campaign before it was released the mueller report was seen as potentially devastating to trump with its details about campaign ties to and the president efforts to hinder the probe yet democrats have hardly mentioned it leading in the polls democratic nominee joe_biden has focused instead on trump handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the divisiveness of his presidency issues that be more likely to resonate with voters meanwhile attacking the probe is core of trump campaign trump and his supporters have often the investigation with trump falsely claiming that president barack_obama spied on his campaign vice_president mike pence falsely suggested at debate last_week that the investigation had vindicated trump those attacks on the probe not win over undecided voters but they could energize trump base at when the campaign needs strong turnout in crucial battleground states moscow president_vladimir putin thursday there is no for china military alliance but noted it could be forged in the future putin statement signaled deepening ties between moscow and beijing amid the leader also made strong call for extending the last remaining arms_control pact between moscow and washington asked during video conference with international foreign_policy experts thursday whether military union between moscow and beijing was possible putin replied that we don it but theoretically it quite possible to imagine it perceive any ballistic missile launched at its territory as nuclear attack that warrants nuclear retaliation the military warned in an article published friday and china have hailed their strategic_partnership but so far rejected any talk about the possibility of their forming military alliance putin pointed to the war games that the armed forces of china and held as signal of the countries burgeoning military cooperation putin also noted that has shared sensitive military technologies that helped significantly boost china military potential but didn mention any specifics saying the information was sensitive any doubt our cooperation with china is bolstering the defense capability of china army he adding that the future could see closer

crimea accusations of meddling in the presidential_election and other rifts host of scenarios could push china and the united_states into some kind of conflict putin on thursday emphasized the importance of extending that expires in february last arms_control pact with the united_states earlier this week the united_states and signaled their readiness to accept compromises to salvage the start treaty just weeks ahead of the presidential_election in which president donald_trump faces strong challenge former vice_president joe_biden whose campaign has accused trump of being soft on start was signed in by then president barack_obama and then president dmitry medvedev the pact limits each country to no more than deployed nuclear warheads and deployed missiles and bombers and envisages sweeping on site inspections to verify compliance had offered to extend the pact any conditions while the trump administration initially insisted that it could only be renewed if china agreed to join china has refused to consider the idea the recently modified its stance and proposed extension of the treaty but it must be coupled with the imposition of broader cap on nuclear warheads the kremlin initially resisted washington demand but its position shifted this week with the foreign ministry stating that moscow can accept freeze on warheads if the agrees to put forward no additional demands putin didn address the issue of the freeze on warheads but he emphasized the importance of salvaging start the question is whether to keep the existing treaty as it is begin detailed discussion and try to reach compromise in or lose that treaty altogether leaving ourselves and the united_states along with the rest of the world any agreement restricting an arms race he believe the second option is worse at the same he added that wasn clinging to the treaty and ensure its security it he pointed at and indicated readiness to include them in future pact if our partners decide that they don it so be it we can stop them he security not be hurt particularly because we have the most advanced weapons systems the successful test launch of the zircon hypersonic cruise missile comes on vladimir putins birthday despite indications earlier this week that and the were inching closer to deal on start the top negotiator that dramatic differences still remain and strongly warned washington against making demands sergei ryabkov cautioned the against pressing its demand for more intrusive control verification measures like those that existed in the and aren envisaged by the start the diplomat argued that control mechanisms could be discussed as of future deal saying firmly that not accept the demand that amounts to legitimate espionage if it doesn suit the for some reason then there be no deal ryabkov was quoted by the interfax agency as saying for travel to the united_states on temporary basis tourism temporary employment study and exchange for foreign citizens

education opportunities in the that you not find anywhere else in the world bolshoy deviatinsky pereulok no moscow federation phone fax so mr ambassador as you mentioned the for the last months was unusual so frustration for people so bad and culture has always been good retreat for people to boost up their energy morale spirits and everything so very happy to talk to you about cultural positive aspects of your activities and american relations so please tell us about the initiative regarding the hermitage foundation and hermitage state museum thank_you konstantin it pleasure to be talking about something is as exciting and as important as this program have to we were talking at the outset about how covid has impacted the world since we last saw each_other at the beginning of this in january among other things it prevented me going to st_petersburg in my or months as ambassador which was looking forward to haven been there since and was looking forward to visiting the hermitage among other things so you ve referenced this grant that we ve made through the ambassadors fund for cultural preservation to support the hermitage and can give you little bit little bit of detail on that the project is actually partnership among four organizations there this ambassador fund for cultural preservation which is of the state department bureau of educational and cultural affairs that and then there our role at the embassy and you mentioned the hermitage foundation which is based in york city and then finally there the state hermitage museum in st_petersburg and among all four of these these organizations we came together to come up with project to restore three frescoes of the raphael school as of the commemoration of the th anniversary of the death of raphael and that what we focused on these frescoes were painted between and on the wall of villa in italy and they were actually acquired by the hermitage in but over the past years the frescoes have suffered considerable exposure to the elements and prior restoration efforts were imperfect so the program that we sponsoring is to restore those frescoes which is urgently needed and as it done in connection with the th anniversary of raphael death and we hopeful that after they restored that there be really an unveiling of the true beauty of the frescoes not just to the public but to the world which is you the hermitage museum is of course cultural treasure of but really of the world mean the hermitage is such literally treasure of art and culture so with this grant we doing the program is done we ve been working with the executive director of the hermitage foundation and want to credit her saranna biel cohen working on behalf of the foundation and of course the director of the hermitage museum mikhail piotrovsky want to credit them for their hard work on this project and next week on october the foundation the museum and myself the embassy have virtual launch of the project and anybody any of your readers or you if you interested it ll be at pm on wednesday the th and we ll learn more about the frescoes how they ll be restored and the cultural significance very good and could you couple of words about this ambassador fund for cultural preservation as understand it is deliberate foundation to preserve treasures cultural treasures throughout the world yes indeed it was established nineteen years_ago in it program that operated in over countries and it managed out of the state department in washington and there is process to review proposals and get approval the department of state to provide the funding so this program that we submitted on behalf of the hermitage foundation and the hermitage was in competition against hundreds of other proposals other embassies worldwide and the fact that this project won this grant is sign both of the significance of the project itself and of the cultural partnership between the united_states and and this be the seventh project that we have funded in over the last years or so so it an important sign of the cultural bonds between the united_states and very good you lucky that you prepared the good papers and we are lucky of course russians that this be restored and ask you some questions about other cultural people to people so to relations between and america like sisters cities program or the business cooperation or cooperation in space arctic because there are lot of dimensions of coexistence rather only all the military and strategic ones konstantin you absolutely right and would you there are relations between the government and the government of the federation whether it on strategic and military issues political issues and we all how fraught those relations have been over the last several years in particular but there broader relationship between the united_states and between our peoples cultural and educational exchanges in business in space in the arctic and small topic that like to emphasize but my colleagues here at the embassy are probably sick of hearing me talk about ice hockey which is personal interest of mine but it those connections konstantin that are among the most significant that we have and they are bond that keeps us together when the political situation seems most dire and thing ve observed in my tenure here is how the relationship between the united_states and has changed just in my professional lifetime you came mentioned earlier in our conversation that visited st_petersburg in was private citizen had great interest in and history visited moscow what was then leningrad but visited the soviet_union then and visited leningrad not st_petersburg and if you of all that happened in our relationship between our countries over the last to years how things have changed the ups and downs what grown has been the cultural business all of those ties between our peoples that have grown dramatically and that distinguishes this era that sort of late soviet_era that grew up in in the and when we didn have those ties that keep us together when the political sea gets choppy so for example we have more than businesses invested in doing business here in and that means russians and americans working together it not just the bolshoi traveling to york and performing in york city or you an equivalent theatre company coming the united_states and performing here it is to personal interaction between colleagues in business and that significant and it provides little more ballast for the relationship when as the political seas can get choppy but as those of us who are old enough with some perspective can look over the last three or four decades and see how our relationship has changed our counterparts or years the ambassador and your successor you sure they ll be remarking too on how things have changed since and the relationship between the united_states and remember those dark old days with you with ukraine crimea and syria and libya and nagorno_karabakh and belarus and election interference and cyber this and god knows what our successors are going to be talking about years but what is the fact that we have made the connections that we ve made over the last or years in business in the arts in sports and entertainment it more likely that it positive outcome and more positive developments not just focused on the to negativity yeah you mentioned the amazing figure that thousand businesses are dealing with despite all the sanctions and all the risks connected with sanctions and our cooperation between military in syria also exist and they exchange information so really share your view that the infrastructure of spheres of interrelations is good support to these big politics and of that you absolutely right of that infrastructure is something you mentioned konstantin sister city partnerships we ve got large number this is program that been in existence for decades established by and managed by the government so there an official government relationship that involved here note sister cities international is nonpartisan nonprofit which serves as the national membership organization for individual sister cities counties and states across the united_states sister cities international was created at president eisenhower white_house summit on citizen diplomacy but it is an independent nongovernmental organization end note but these sister city relationships you date into soviet times into the when the five sister city relationships happened and you we ve got cities all across the united_states that are joined with cities across so sarasota florida and vladimir for example burlington vermont and yaroslavl louisville kentucky and perm chicago and moscow and it you it small thing but it an important of our relationship and also the link with business as konstantin because what we ve done here at the embassy and my colleagues at the department of commerce and our counterparts at the ministry of trade is that we have made connections business to business connections with regions and cities in the united_states because of covid we had to do this virtually but we were planning trade mission texas texas companies and the government of the state of texas to the yekaterinburg in the ural region we had to do it because of covid we did it virtually but it was full event the government of the state of texas was involved the governor of the state himself and making those types of regional connections for business is is profitable way forward and ve spoken to secretary ross our secretary of commerce about this and that the secretary himself had phone call recently with trade minister manturov and that an area where we going to continue to pursue making those connections regionally as not just government to government very important because lot of asymmetric information is available in regions people wants to do something but they lack adequate information so thank_you for that effort in yekaterinburg because it our industrial number three or number four city in do you have any plans for cooperation in the arctic because arctic seems to attract attention yes it very relevant and timely topic in our relationship konstantin because as you over the chair of the arctic council in just few months in and the arctic council is very important institution that promotes this vital region as zone of cooperation free conflict and the council itself is an institution where we can discuss sustainable development the environment protection and development of indigenous peoples and it shared interest of the united_states of course has huge chunk of the arctic region within its northern border but the united_states canada the other members of the countries that border the arctic region we all have shared interest in its development and its protection and so my colleagues in washington and our embassy here have been engaged directly with the government with the ministry of foreign affairs in particular met with deputy foreign minister titov couple of months ago to talk about arctic cooperation and role assuming the chair of the arctic council and those discussions have continued between our governments between washington and moscow and the pace of interaction increase as we get closer to when does assume the chair okay thank_you and the last question but our younger audience is always interested about student exchange and with covid lot of zoom classes have but still what is number of russians which are enrolled in american universities and colleges terrific question and could guess off the top of my head but what going to propose is that we get to you with the precise figures for your publication note the latest open doors report shows that for the academic more than russians studied in the us we do not have the figures for current enrollment in online programs end note but what would offer konstantin is we had participated in virtual program that the united_states government that we the embassy helped organize we usually do it in person we bring over representatives colleges and universities in the united_states and they come here to to moscow to other cities and they available to families students parents who are interested in having student study in the united_states because of covid we weren able to do that in person we did it virtually but here the benefit though of that if there silver lining we got more colleges and universities able to participate virtually who wouldn have been able to to send either afford to or couldn send somebody to participate in program in in moscow so what that meant was that the students and their families that were interested and participated got wide variety of wider variety of colleges and universities presented and interested in recruiting them to study in the united_states and you yourself studied at penn won embarrass you by saying how years_ago it was but was out of college myself by then so we neither of us is youngster anymore but you yourself can testify to the benefit of study abroad and getting to another country and seeing how their education system works and number of my colleagues here at the embassy have studied at institutions language culture so it key component and has been for and we really looking to to encourage that and it always fun to meet russians who have studied in the united_states and compare notes about their experience with our expectations and these were these were my remarks and wasn just trying to flatter the participants it fact that we hear us colleges and universities that students are among the most desired are the most serious hardworking and just great additions to the student body which isn this surprise for those of us who or aspire to to it an important of our relationship the broader relationship between our peoples and we certainly want to encourage it and we doing all we can in the face of the covid pandemic to sure that those relationships continue and that they don wither or diminish just because we not able to have in person interaction so my hope is that we ll have large number of students traveling to the united_states and enriching our schools and our campuses as you did in the in philadelphia thank_you and personally am very grateful to you for supporting this students exchange because you if you live in the country it is so difficult to influence you in pushing any misperceptions to engage you in witch hunt and it helps to understand the nature of people and since years_ago returned philadelphia you keep this interest towards america read every american papers read american books watch american television watched the debate tonight put down notes who what what is the argument of that and this is something very profound in our sympathy and relations and desire to improve it because belong to that of society and always openly at every level that we believe that good relations with america can benefit people in medicine in science in culture in sports in engineering in business benefit it it could be rather selfish this point of view but it is beneficial it not hostile and wish that you in your position of ambassador put all your efforts pursue the line in these dark dark days of covid and the distraction of regular relationships oh you so right and had great experience few months ago and can add to all of the categories you listed law and the legal profession so spoke to law students it was probably couple of hundred it was virtual virtual event did it by zoom or some other electronic means which my colleagues are better able to describe and function than just sit in front of the camera and talk but what was fascinating was for of those students was the american that they really had chance to engage with in their young lives and we had lot in common we talked about our legal education some of their professors were on the call and we got to share few comments about law professors and what it was like joining profession what their expectations were and it just an example in our lives we ve both experienced this russians and americans there are so things that we have in common whether we engineers or ballet dancers or hockey players or authors or lawyers people are people and the more that we can have these exchanges trade experiences explore how our systems are different and how they similar it breaks down stereotypes and it just makes things between our countries makes the relationship stronger and makes it more difficult for political winds to blow the relationship in really dangerous direction the more we understand each_other the better we ll be able to overcome some of these differences which would separate us yeah thank_you mr ambassador do you what noticed that what you talked today was actually about the substance of american relations because usually lot of experts view the of to america and vice versa only as means to solve some others country problems like we to solve problem in north_korea or in iran or in afghanistan or it here but it never table which belongs to us all spheres which you mentioned just belong to and america in every aspect and it is most valuable in this relation that we have the body of mutual interest and thank_you for understanding that and pursuing this line you so right and it not to diminish the importance of those geopolitical issues which spend you the vast amount of my focused on and you write about and we all interested in and they extremely important to the world and global security and peace and prosperity but if we talking about the united_states and it not just those issues and our relationship has history was joking with the deputy foreign minister titov we were we were talking about the arctic and commented on the fact that have to thank then the empire for giving the united_states stake in the arctic by selling us alaska right so our relationship goes way to when secretary of state seward purchased alaska and made us of eventually the arctic council but we shared laugh over that but it just an example of over the united_states and we have to deal with each_other on these political issues but on broader level people to people we have stronger ties than we did when was growing up in the and and people to people ties educational and so forth the political issues are as challenging and maybe more challenging in some ways than they were for my predecessors or years_ago when it was the soviet_union versus the west and the united_states but in any event as as we keep talking about positive things like this it give us more space to try to work out the more difficult political issues as thank_you very for this interview and looking forward to talk with you on some other issues maybe later because there were lot of substantial things you conveyed it very important for our people because they asymmetrically informed about the positions because they don understand how profound is your access to your job and your mission as ambassador here thank_you konstantin look forward to continuing this conversation hope in person soon but if not continuing through zoom so look forward to speaking again soon end by october topics soyuz booster and fregat upper stage successfully delivered an upgraded glonass navigation satellite to an orbit

the paper the increasing ambiguity turkish relations has complicated relations with azerbaijan armenia and azerbaijan have incorporated friendly relations with into wider strategy former armenian foreign minister vartan oskanian described multivectoral approach which foreign_policy vectors point different directions entails seeking close relations with and assistance powers other than primarily the united_states and the european union large armenian diasporas the united_states and france have aided this endeavor contrast poor record democracy and human_rights the armenian diaspora efforts the united_states have hobbled azerbaijan the united_states congressional legislation blocked most assistance azerbaijan until waiver authority was granted the wake the september terrorist attacks and azerbaijan subsequent role assisting antiterrorism efforts elsewhere georgia nationalism remains centered the rejection since the massacre unarmed civilians soviet troops the capital tbilisi and the post independence presidency former soviet dissident and extreme nationalist zviad gamsakhurdia georgian society has generally come view usurping occupier february the the red army invaded tbilisi still observed annually soviet occupation georgians explain away decades fawning over the occupiers ambassador did for all those years that the russians ruled told them loved them and they actually believed georgian warlords deposed gamsakhurdia january and installed former soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze weak figurehead his tenure president involved constant renegotiation his powers gain ascendancy over those warlords the early still his weakest vis vis the warlords and pressured support for abkhaz and ossetian separatism tried harness not reverse the extreme nationalism his predecessor supporters especially those displaced abkhazia backed separatists for their russians have acted emotionally the georgians seeing georgia aspirations toward the north atlantic treaty organization nato and the the betrayal its once advantageous position within moscow empire during regularly occurring period heightened tensions normally calm senior diplomat asked when the soviet_union was ruled people named jughashvili orjonikidze and beria just who was occupying whom after the september attacks troops were arriving georgia train georgians embittered general recalling the old times officers warm reception georgia over countless song and wine filled banquets the americans they teach the georgians fight reality the georgians teach the americans sing cannot deal with armenia azerbaijan and georgia isolation because the countries own relations with another are dense and fraught with tension and conflict most salient the karabakh_conflict over which armenians and azerbaijanis have shed blood since both_sides appeal for support and view amity toward the other side betrayal the early years tried profit the conflict clandestinely providing weaponry and mercenaries both_sides and russians backed coups install puppets azerbaijan but both backfired former azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov attempt return moscow was thwarted the nationalist azerbaijan popular front and surat huseynov revolt against the popular front was hijacked aliyev who took power for himself alone thereafter stepped the region since brokering ceasefire the karabakh_conflict moscow has limited its interventions trying unsuccessfully get the sides agree led peacekeeping force the sort moscow installed control the abkhazia south_ossetia and transdniestria separatist conflicts remains supplier weaponry both_sides and every major arms sale provokes protests the other because azerbaijan oil revenues expanded has been able diversify its defense procurements but armenia remains dependent for arms and security guarantees georgia closely intertwined with both armenia and azerbaijan there are large armenian and azerbaijani minorities georgia separatist abkhazia armenians actually outnumber the abkhaz despite initial nationalist difficulties borchaly azerbaijani inhabited section georgia georgian azerbaijani relations have been good almost since georgia independence largely thanks reconciliation convenience between soviet_era rivals eduard shevardnadze and heydar aliyev aliyev needed georgia enable the western transit azerbaijan hydrocarbon exports and the import western goods turkey shevardnadze needed azerbaijan secure oil and gas pipelines provide both transit royalties and strategic importance the west also needed aliyev help ensure that the large azerbaijani population georgia reliably voted for shevardnadze political grouping the citizens union georgian armenian relations have been trickier portion the armenian population georgia concentrated javakheti near large soviet later military base that fueled the region economy until was closed the javakhk armenians sought independence apparently with encouragement but armenia only transit routes and the west lay through georgia the karabakh_conflict had closed armenia borders with turkey and azerbaijan the government then armenian president levon ter petrosyan tamped down javakhk separatism relations between the countries grew closer after mikheil saakashvili came the presidency georgia and they have remained friendly under subsequent leaders this policy the south_caucasus intertwined with the north caucasus which has devoted the blood and treasure generations and which post_soviet sees key the integrity the state domestic security concerns have intruded the south_caucasus number areas power ebbed away the end the soviet_era the army for the centuries no_longer wielded the decisive force the region the turkish third army was the most powerful military the region and locals adapted the strategic effects threw its diminished resources into the caucasus suppress the chechen rebellion and met defeat subsequent the region and its demands adapt the conventional armed forces europe treaty allow for greater freedom movement the flank stemmed its perceived redress the military imbalance and reassert power and influence the region address moves adapt the treaty azerbaijan and georgia allied with moldova and ukraine form what later solidified into the organization for democracy and economic development known simply the guam ossetians ethno linguistically and religiously different their neighbors have been principal allies the north caucasus for centuries dealt with host ethnic nationalisms the years after the soviet_collapse chechen separatism and later armed islamist movement north ossetia gained strategic importance and leverage with leadership has used that leverage ensure robust support for south ossetian separatism georgia likewise other ethnic groups the mountains the north caucasus for example the chechens kabardians and cherkes saw abkhaz separatism georgia the validation their own ethnic nationalisms with facilitation called volunteers made their way abkhazia join the separatist war against georgia among the most effective these was the chechen shamil basayev who was later archnemesis the russians but their ally that struggle during the second chechen war fighters and their families took refuge georgia pankisi gorge which was effectively outside the georgian government control president boris yeltsin called shevardnadze november demand the reinstatement border troops georgia and passage for military units through georgia attack pankisi the south shevardnadze stalled and then called the americans dissuade yeltsin later after the september terrorist attacks the united_states sent troops train the georgians restore security pankisi forestalling actions there worse the point view shevardnadze made deal with ruslan gelayev chechen commander sheltering the pankisi gorge launch attack abkhaz held territory the attack failed but the authorities viewed this series events proof that georgia was treacherous and untrustworthy lastly azerbaijan shares border and considerable ethnic overlap with dagestan autonomous republic where salafist proselytizing made extensive inroads the after some years full fledged islamist guerrilla movement formed and linked with the remains the armed chechen nationalist movement which also fell under salafist influence when attacks began authorities dagestan security cooperation with azerbaijan gained importance for internal security the stage was thus set early for consistent static policy toward the south_caucasus economy force balancing act preserve traditional friendship and strategic alliance with armenia harming economic and security relationship with azerbaijan and constant emotional and ever deepening hostility toward georgia views the international arena series camps each centered power whose greatness confirmed possessing camp has been keen ensure that the nations forged out former soviet republics remain its camp and has formed multinational institutions cement those relations initially had hopes that the commonwealth independent states cis formed when the soviet_union broke might fill the bill azerbaijan and armenia joined the cis its inception but was not until that georgia president shevardnadze under military pressure support abkhaz separatism and facing rebellion ousted former president gamsakhurdia reluctantly acceded georgia withdrew the cis after the country defeat the russo georgian war with the cis having little influence put forward other institutions accomplish the task the collective security treaty originally signed became the collective security treaty organization csto designed counterweight nato armenia joined relieve its security concerns with regard turkey azerbaijan and georgia did not the eurasian customs union officially formed but active onward also included armenia but not azerbaijan georgia turned the customs union into the eurasian economic union eaeu intended mirror image the moscow ongoing attempts equate the organizations the international stage has had significant effects the caucasus noted later this paper azerbaijan was able avoid joining called camp thanks its independent oil revenues which have grown for both azerbaijan and other post_soviet caspian littoral states the early moscow ability project power was low and could only protest ineffectually when littoral countries signed hydrocarbon extraction contracts the absence international agreement define national rights the caspian azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan brought western energy majors fearing reaction azerbaijan signed its major contract the status the caspian was not codified preliminarily until and this treaty covers exploitation the seabed could not fight joined settling for sharing the profits hydrocarbon development and transit for the mid the united_states and maneuvered against another through their respective support pipelines the united_states heavily promoted the baku tbilisi ceyhan btc pipeline alternative monopoly hydrocarbon transit the west however doctrine demanded that the pipeline commercially viable its own right and the united_states refused put resources into boosting that viability recognizing this banked the oil majors desire save money transporting the oil tanker across the black sea and through the turkish straits but when then chair john browne visited istanbul and inspected the narrow bosphorus passage decided the route was too risky and threw the weight the oil majors behind btc closest relationship the south_caucasus remains with armenia the country most firmly entrenched camp frequently called strategic alliance and for armenia this certainly the case troops based its second largest city gyumri form trip wire against turkish military action while azerbaijan generally deals with other countries transactionally another criterion takes precedence their stance armenia and the karabakh_conflict this the trickiest situation for manage azerbaijan largest trading partner the caucasus the countries have important common issues regarding hydrocarbons and sees strategic aim keeping azerbaijan out what calls the western camp therefore while supporting armenia has tried avoid alienating azerbaijan during the recent surge fighting until was discreet about its arms sales armenia avoid provoking azerbaijan denying reports large arms transfers when they surfaced more recently has started transferring increasingly sophisticated weaponry both_sides and has been more open about its balancing for example signed lease its military base gyumri extending and agreed sell surface air missiles azerbaijan this balancing involved attempts mediate between azerbaijan and armenia resolve the karabakh_conflict since has been chair the minsk group body under the aegis the organization for security and operation europe osce and composed number countries interested brokering peace the united_states and france joined chairs and the three countries have conducted all negotiations thereafter significant input the other group members this structure has facilitated west cooperation keep politically insoluble problem flaring into war and metastasizing beyond the actual frontline states when dmitry medvedev was president poured great efforts into peace initiatives and with french and assent came dominate the process this campaign medvedev also supported the opening between armenia and turkey azerbaijan closest ally that rapprochement failed however due opposition key constituencies both_sides ultimately azerbaijan and armenia were not interested negotiated solution and medvedev initiative foundered relations with georgia quickly went into downward spiral after the soviet_collapse used substantial military force ensure the survival and then victory the separatist rebellion abkhazia and leveraged that and revolt gamsakhurdia force shevardnadze accept peacekeeping force western georgia still hostile backed attempts and assassinate shevardnadze until the latter attempt shevardnadze had been trying play and the united_states off against each_other but these actions drove shevardnadze squarely into the arms the united_states the russians loathed shevardnadze for his role the collapse the soviet bloc television program was reviled the ostap bender the soviet_union after the con man protagonist the classic soviet comic novel but that feeling paled beside the emotions stoked the leadership the flamboyant and mercurial mikheil saakashvili who ousted shevardnadze the end and became president that saakashvili also ousted the quasi independent aslan abashidze his rule over the autonomous batumi region which housed military base also tensions flared south_ossetia retaliated over the next few years banning the import georgian products banning flights between and georgia closing the land border between the countries and launching aggressive campaign against ethnic georgians citizens their businesses and their families closed off most north ossetia foreigners allowing preparations for war proceed unseen the outside world and tensions flared again south_ossetia troops invaded defeating georgia forces short order occupying parts georgia outside abkhazia and south_ossetia and incorporating these conquests into the separatist statelets which shortly thererafter recognized independent but the war also brought the expansion competitor presence the small neutral osce mission was scrapped and large monitoring mission was put its place despite the limitations placed that mission the overall presence and commitment sharply increased putin return the presidency came with more assertive foreign_policy leaders wholly dependent were installed the separatist entities supported south_ossetia and abkhazia replacing established leaders who were pro but possessed their own independent power bases more importantly began treat the european union not just nato strategic rival intent taking over parts what medvedev had called sphere five years earlier that view had been restricted the senior officers the hard power ministries primarily the military internal affairs and security services after putin return the presidency became official policy the ukrainian crisis began with putin pressuring both ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and armenian president serzh sargsyan into repudiating the association agreements they had signed and instead joining the nascent centric eaeu the pressure sargsyan included putin visit azerbaijan capital baku discuss arms sales yanukovych caving putin pressure triggered the revolution dignity ukraine and his eventual downfall sargsyan did not immediately face the same consequences explained the nation that security concerns necessitated joining the led organization that only could safeguard armenia its neighbors however after rejecting the sargsyan immediately tried placate negotiations eventually restarted trade agreement and armenia signed comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with the after few protests armenians fell line with sargsyan capitulation putin wishes they assumed their security expectations would met and that this change was worth the economic disadvantages giving the association with the indeed when few months later occupied crimea and annexed after the fig leaf controlled referendum armenians saw this model and justification for future annexation nagornyy_karabakh and the surrounding territories actions had called into question all territorial dispositions after the soviet_collapse which had been agreed among the union republics codified the cis treaty and endorsed the international community with borders questioned and more capable projecting power was better close ally than potential victim but april armenians suffered rude awakening april azerbaijan began military operation along the line contact karabakh and over the next four days managed regain few strategic points occupied the karabakh armenians years before reaction was maintain its balancing act foreign minister sergey lavrov went the region explicitly neutral mediator brought ceasefire plan and proposed the peacekeeping force that had been rejected years earlier that approach did not over with the armenian populace their view armenia was treaty ally and had given european aspirations stay camp and therefore should armenia side however far was concerned legally the combat had nothing with armenia but was between nagornyy_karabakh and azerbaijan the armenian people did not see that way after being convinced their leaders over generation that karabakh and armenia had become single polity sargsyan who initially supported the idea peacekeeping force was seen having sold out armenian interests then had backtrack putting fatal cracks his prestige and authority almost immediately mutinies and demonstrations broke out occasionally with subtle anti flavor july group gunmen calling themselves sasna tsrer daredevils sassoun armenian epic poem violently took over police station and held out against government forces for weeks demanding sargsyan resignation after they surrendered they retained widespread support which translated into people fed with the ruling elite and with other factors such notorious murder soldier price hikes the owned electricity supplier and continued arms sales azerbaijan further exacerbated popular discontent faced with term limits when his presidency was expire sargsyan chose the standard post_soviet autocratic solutions staying power establishing parliamentary system turning the presidency into figurehead and becoming prime_minister sargsyan and his dashnak nationalist allies duly won parliamentary elections and figurehead president was due course elected then the play went off script the aggrieved populace rose demonstrations and just over month sargsyan was ousted opposition_leader nikol pashinyan was installed acting prime_minister and elections affirmed his position later the far this scenario resembles the color revolutions that putin had railed against for the previous fifteen years and had tried reverse through military force georgia syria and ukraine but instead condemning pashinyan who had sharply criticized during the demonstrations and lending full support sargsyan putin most loyal supporters putin was remarkably restrained throughout and had friendly and supportive meeting with pashinyan just days after the latter took power publicly offering him his congratulations and best wishes possible that blamed sargsyan for the anti sentiment following the clashes april but also clear that pashinyan made efforts reassure putin like the entire armenian electorate understood that remained the guarantor armenia security vis vis its larger neighbors also understood that any rift with would create vulnerability that azerbaijan could exploit with regard karabakh pashinyan knew could not afford any daylight between armenia and left armenia the eaeu and csto made clear that would pursue democratic system but also that viewed democracy firm belief rather_than geopolitical orientation making clear the distinction perhaps the fact that putin knew this implying major changes armenia strategic orientation occasioned his restraint there threat that armenia leave its camp can continue balancing its policy toward azerbaijan and armenia azerbaijan the type country with which putin seems feel comfortable stable autocracy whose cautious ruler pursues consistent and predictable policies azerbaijan causes few headaches for and demands only that its transactional approach reciprocated president ilham aliyev began his rule only three years after putin took over his father heydar aliyev had ruled azerbaijan for decade before that not counting the soviet period when also ruled the country his own fiefdom heydar aliyev the senior most ranks the soviet state communist_party and security services made his attitude very different other post_soviet rulers some whom had been minor provincial apparatchiki soviet times and saw moscow the source all power heydar aliyev treated post_soviet rulers the fealty fear that some his contemporaries showed ilham aliyev does not have the experience ability his father but has inherited that legacy autonomous sovereignty pashinyan intends show that democracy belief not geopolitical choice the aliyevs have since shown that the same true autocracy azerbaijan and have enjoyed functional transactional relationship that cordial neighborly and devoid emotion some extent azerbaijan grew ideologically closer the wake the ukraine crisis both countries saw themselves attacked and undermined fifth column western supported civil_society and nongovernmental organizations the chief azerbaijan presidential apparatus usually considered closest the azerbaijani leadership published scathing article outlining that worldview implied that charges human_rights violations against country only proved that its leadership was defending its sovereignty but ideological sympathy never overcame azerbaijan transactional approach relations with azerbaijan demanded sharp increase the rent was paying for the soviet_era qabala radar station the station was the soviet and strategic early warning system and therefore the united_states favored its continued functioning help reduce uncertainty about potential missile launches nonetheless azerbaijan stuck its price demands and the russians eventually closed the station the end apart its transactional approach the azerbaijani leadership has single prism for judging the actions all other countries the karabakh_conflict since independence azerbaijan has rejected virtually all forms multilateral cooperation involving armenia that has imposed durable limit the extent rapprochement with for example azerbaijan has not joined the csto which armenia member would have renounce any military solution the karabakh_conflict and has been tenet faith azerbaijan that only the credible threat military solution can pressure armenia negotiate seriously nor has azerbaijan joined the eaeu armenia did joining could limit azerbaijan ability its economic leverage marshal international support karabakh and counter armenian diaspora influence the west particularly the united_states and france indeed because annexation crimea calls into question the borders the former soviet republics which the republics recognize state borders under the alma ata declaration december also calls into question the basis for azerbaijani claims sovereignty over nagornyy_karabakh moreover for the last fifteen years proposed principles for negotiated peace the karabakh_conflict have included binding expression the popular the ultimate disposition the territory the staged referendum crimea drove home the azerbaijanis how easy for the power with boots the ground ensure its desired outcome such vote all all since azerbaijan has become anything more transactional its approach the offensive karabakh which might earlier have been deterred reluctance antagonize can seen example the fighting azerbaijan initiated september can also seen transaction with made possible turkish intervention sure aim the offensive regain territory and therefore remove bargaining chips armenia side the board but perhaps the larger aim threaten putin with instability and possibly region wide war does not force deep concessions armenia aliyev ignored lavrov initial offer the return provinces exchange for being allowed deploy peacekeeping force whatever the outcome clear that azerbaijan less partner and more problem solved azerbaijan tries solve its problem through closer relations with particular turkey and china turkey has been azerbaijan main advocate the international sphere aside ethnic kinship significant azeri population lives eastern turkey and deep historical links before the soviet takeover turkey quick cite certain protectorate rights granted under the treaties moscow and kars since independence azerbaijan has seen turkey counterweight power present however turkey has its own complex relations with turkey enjoys the positive effects continued close energy and pipeline relations personal interactions between putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan but offsetting these effects are sharp differences between turkey and the conflicts syria and libya azerbaijan seeks ensure that turkey support vis vis unwavering turkey support azerbaijan and reported direct military involvement the autumn fighting have granted azerbaijan unprecedented room for maneuver vis vis both the battlefield and with regard mediation efforts took the kremlin almost weeks arrange putin aliyev phone call humanitarian truce brokered lavrov fell apart almost immediately china has increased its engagement with the caucasus its belt and road initiative though neither its trade nor investment the region compare with its far more massive engagement central asia its main partner the region azerbaijan which has the largest population economy and reserves natural resources the partnership makes sense geopolitically although china major trading partner for armenia and georgia armenia too dependent pried loose and china probably wary sensitivities georgia china has become the third largest source imports for azerbaijan after and turkey azerbaijan presents the most potential for future political rapprochement and china unlike the west not burdened with concerns over azerbaijan human_rights record azerbaijan hopes that the belt and road initiative progresses china increase its azerbaijan for the transit cargo europe floating cargo across the caspian and loading onto the railroad link opened between baku and kars turkey via georgia putin once famously declared that would hang saakashvili his testicles that promise remains unfulfilled but not for want trying saakashvili lost his parliamentary majority and was voted out office putin thought saakashvili ouster the billionaire and until shortly before then citizen bidzina ivanishvili and his georgian dream party would liberate wellspring affection for was for disappointment the georgian populace remains deeply suspicious late nato initiated major assistance program the substantial nato georgia package sharply ramping security cooperation with the georgian dream government hostile and aggressive policy toward georgia too remains unchanged always the pressure point between and georgia has been separatism namely the backed polities abkhazia and south_ossetia the run putin return the presidency serving local officials areas controlled especially the supported south_ossetia and abkhazia and transdniestria outside the region were ousted with moscow backing newcomers who had little local support and who would owe loyalty and obedience putin alone the end edmund kokoity who had ruled south_ossetia since was forced resign the leadership and was ultimately replaced leonid tibilov veteran the kgb abkhazia the death sergei bagapsh triggered premature power struggle that threw the plans off track the elections that followed moscow chosen candidate raul khajimba was defeated however with the intervention putin fixer vladislav surkov president alexander ankvab was ousted june and khajimba was installed then had occupied and annexed crimea and had instigated and supported armed separatist uprisings donbass kharkiv and odessa response the west had imposed sanctions perhaps this left putin and his regime less concerned with placating western opinion and moved annex the separatists all but name early october the month after khajimba inauguration presented abkhazia with draft treaty alliance integration and partnership whose main points were the takeover key executive departments the abkhaz state their homologues with best nominal abkhazian security institutions serving fig leaf presented south_ossetia with draft comprising identical terms about the same though the public announcement came november the treaties that were eventually signed the abkhaz won face saving concessions the russians took four drafts before the south ossetians signed but their version was closer the original the close informal relations between south_ossetia and north ossetia made the words paper less important the stifling embrace moscow and the suspected poisoning khajimba electoral rival led the ouster khajimba early and his replacement aslan bzhania himself veteran the kgb south_ossetia anatoliy bibilov who had floated between the north and south ossetian militaries defeated tibilov actions have continued ensure that georgian resentment over the remains open wound the process borderization continues south_ossetia border troops periodically erect border fences that enclose bits land hitherto under georgian control july border fences cut off the strategic baku supsa oil pipeline the line that carried azerbaijani early oil market the west before the main baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline was completed has not interfered with the oil flow but the implied threat clear for its appears that georgia under saakashvili tried return this threat reopening links with chechen and islamist rebel groups the north caucasus shevardnadze had done with the chechen commander gelayev charged and again after murky incident the lopota gorge between the pankisi gorge and dagestan that georgia was arming and training chechen militants fight inside several years after saakashvili was replaced the less anti georgian dream party the chechen commander involved the lopota incident was killed georgian security forces tbilisi thus cycle perceived provocations followed emotional reactions and retaliations continues today most recently mere choice seating meeting led crisis between the countries june the assembly orthodoxy met the parliament tbilisi with orthodox countries attendance this was presumably intended gesture reconciliation between the orthodox majorities and georgia june member the state duma presided over the session and sat the georgian parliament chair seat violent street protests immediately broke out tbilisi disrupting the meeting and forcing the resignation georgia parliament chair the following amid continuing protests against tbilisi putin ordered the cessation direct flights between georgia and had the run the war the incident highlights that symbols power relations evoke both charged emotions and material retaliations and that the pattern events repeated for the foreseeable future hard not conclude that putin personal overreach ukraine has led suboptimal results for the south_caucasus when resumed the presidency putin increased engagement with the south_caucasus perhaps hoping gather some castaway stones closer into the camp autumn everything seemed going his way armenia and ukraine had bowed his demands reject association agreements with the and sign instead with the eaeu that putin had singlehandedly created promoted and dominated relations with azerbaijan were keel expenditure effort and georgia despised saakashvili had been replaced billionaire whose government was floating trial balloons about normalizing relations with moscow despite recognition the independence abkhazia and south_ossetia but relations with all three south_caucasus countries reverted type after intervention ukraine moscow stifling embrace rulers such sargsyan and khajimba led popular discontent and their forcible ousters the precedents set ukrainian territory led azerbaijan proceed with extreme caution its relations with and expansionist policies with regard abkhazia and south_ossetia have guaranteed the hostility the georgian populace and repudiation what might have been friendlier government observers have noted major outside powers such china turkey and the have capitalized local suspicions they have developed strong interests all three south_caucasus countries and have the wherewithal defend those interests against maneuvering while also providing the locals with greater room for maneuver turkey willingness major military role support azerbaijan the fighting that began september shows that power no_longer has the deterrent effect once did against

joe_biden has become the favorite topic conversation fancy restaurants and the corridors power the prevailing view that victory for biden would bad for because democratic administration expected impose economic sanctions moscow punishment for its bad behavior and foremost for its interference the presidential_election this view widely shared pro kremlin pundits senior officials and the executives state owned enterprises and promoted the few remaining independent media outlets such the newsletter daily staple the information diet the upper middle class more nuanced view biden held some people working issues the government president who not tainted suspicion being asset and who knows how organize normal process for national_security discussions able restore some guardrails the relationship and prevent further deterioration those people argue president biden would not able pay close attention since and his senior advisers overwhelmed domestic issues and otherwise focusing china but possible democratic administration appears open retaining some pillars the arms_control regime and discussing rules competition cyberspace and could more clear eyed and therefore skeptical

between washington and moscow and would raise the probability sanctions the country already operating under international sanctions some key sectors and officials close putin for actions its annexation crimea ukraine interference the election and reported involvement nerve agent attack the andrius tursa central and eastern europe advisor teneo intelligence win for biden would improve

biden was heavily involved vice_president moscow could hardly expect any meaningful easing sanctions and that potential biden presidency could lead more stringent enforcement existing measures the

biden harris ticket sign for cnn opinions join and both countries are cooperating more than ever but would moscow really help beijing that way has the knowledge but china has the money would moscow help beijing for the right price appears that china relying how and experience develop the reactor for its nuclear aircraft carrier the reports china appears studying the nuclear reactors largest icebreakers approach that the soviet_union also took when planned build nuclear carriers the specifically has invited china bid the construction class nuclear icebreaker necessarily requiring the development surface ship based reactors this approach stands contrast how the united_states and france developed nuclear reactors for their largest carriers but probably represents the best choice for china this point appreciate what stake china pursuit nuclear powered surface warships important review the experience the united_states and the ussr after the successful development the uss and the class nuclear attack submarines the merchant ship provided proof concept regarding nuclear propulsion the usn began evaluate nuclear power for surface warships the usn nuclear surface warship was the cruiser uss commissioned was powered reactors generating enough power produce speed knots for the ton cruiser hull the usn rapidly followed with uss enterprise powered reactors each quite similar construction and output the those reactors generated each translating shp driving the ton knots few other nuclear cruisers and destroyers followed but the advantages nuclear power surface warfare ships was limited cost aircraft carriers were different story the class which began enter service reactors each rated the recently commissioned uss carries reactors capable generating the extra power generation capacity the has little with speed rather the power provides surplus usable for variety different systems emals and highly sophisticated sensors down the road the extra energy power point defense lasers and similar equipment overall the reactors open space modernize and modify the vessels keeping them effective for their decades project life the soviet experience was somewhat different while the soviets enjoyed considerable success developing nuclear reactors for submarines they approached the question surface warships more carefully the nuclear powered soviet ship was the icebreaker commissioned with three reactors each between and the soviets would commission nine more nuclear icebreakers the and classes generally displacing between and tons and carrying reactors capable these ships provided valuable experience but the soviets were slow the leap nuclear powered surface combatants because soviet warships were expected operate closer home than their counterparts however the soviets began building the four ships the class ton battlecruisers with both nuclear and conventional propulsion reports differ the power capacity the reactors with range these reactors would also have powered the class supercarriers class ships that was canceled upon the collapse the ussr the chinese are undoubtedly thinking along lines similar those the late soviets conventional catobar carrier suggest ship roughly the size and sophistication the which course would require immense power generation capabilities like the united_states china wants excess power generation order field suite future weapons and sensors for this purpose china needs reactors more powerful than those that currently uses its submarines and building icebreakers for provide the necessary experience this approach stands contrast that the french navy which decided upscale based experience building nuclear reactors for submarines while france has enjoyed success with nuclear subs the widely believed underpowered relative other fleet carriers uses areva reactors the same type employed french submarines these reactors provide each but only drive the ton carrier some knots worth noting that india considered but wisely rejected the idea building ins vishal nuclear carrier largely because the technical challenges developing powerful enough reactor the idea using technical and nuclear how certainly makes sense the perspective the people liberation army navy the plan doesn have the luxury the incremental approach adopted the united_states and has good reason find the french approach insufficient its needs that the russians seem okay with letting the chinese study their icebreakers suggests once again that moscow and beijing currently see cooperation their term interests course

direct competition yandex the internet and search company the online bank tinkoff while the banking giant sberbank unveiled suite technology products just days later the reported analysts also point out that overdue digitization surge and there could easily room for both emerge winners but behind this another conflict the kremlin ever expanding attempts bring technology firms under the state control both companies have played role these efforts yandex has been under kremlin give the government more influence over its decisions and sberbank state owned enterprise the latter the government corporate takeovers such yandex acquisition tinkoff are pushing major tech_companies into ever growing conglomerates controlled either directly the government other actors trusted advance kremlin internet policy but the kremlin toolkit coercion broader and more international than this tactic the government has recognized the scale political and economic power wielded internet companies and sought channel that power toward its own ends since war against ukraine the government has carried out rapidly escalating crackdown internet freedom but the hostile attitude toward freedom information underlying internet policy has changed little since vladimir_putin took office the kremlin strategy for the internet has ways mirrored the approaches used early the putin era bring major broadcast and print media then the major means information dissemination under effective government control that the internet played meaningful role how most the public read the communicated with another and therefore escaped major attempts government interference the years since however the importance dramatically most the world controlling the internet has become higher priority for government willing ever more authoritarian tactics addition its efforts control online media outlets the government recognition the internet power tool for communication has prioritized maximizing its surveillance potential and enlisted social_media and other tech_companies this push through publicly enacted measures has created legal and technological framework for the internet under which only encryption rather_than any legal protection can effectively prevent the authorities viewing the content any internet traffic within the country third goal which receives surprisingly little attention relative its potential significance enlist internet companies the government foreign espionage efforts this topic downplayed due justified cynicism would course naive assume that the government alone such conduct authoritarian and democratic governments alike regularly demand user information most often calling necessary for the criminal justice process but has had unique case made public april pavel durov the founder vkontakte known most popular social_media platform received the previous december the country federal security service fsb which responsible for domestic security but also foreign electronic surveillance the letter demanded the personal users running popular groups involved the ukrainian euromaidan protests movement that would ultimately result the ouster ukrainian president viktor yanukovych the fsb demands demonstrate the power the government requisition user privately owned social_media companies expressly order conduct espionage abroad what sets this apart the surveillance practices most democratic governments the united_states the lack any political legal checks that could serve protect users privacy when edward snowden disclosure the prism program revealed that intelligence was collecting social_media platforms such surveillance became major story politics tech_companies their users behalf changed their practices better protect user government collection and challenge its surveillance practices earning praise the american civil liberties union and other privacy activists where the putin regime had already destroyed judicial independence asserted control most media outlets and seriously weakened civil_society durov revelation had little impact public discourse surveillance and the tech sector already that point largely under kremlin control produced comparable response story illustrative the different tactics broadly employed the government its efforts gain control when durov published his letter the fsb four months after receiving had already fled that final conflict was only the latest between durov and the government that included incident when durov refused prosecutor order down pages being used organize protests against fraudulent parliamentary elections provoking police special forces raid his apartment raids masked and armed police the offices tech_companies and the homes their owners are they are some extent all profitable parts the economy these extortion tactics are often paired with corporate ownership maneuvers aimed bringing those companies under the ownership state_controlled companies kremlin friendly businessmen the case the personal pressure against durov occurred against backdrop tech giant owned the billionaire and close putin ally alisher usmanov acquire controlling stake when mail few months after durov fled the company added most popular social network product portfolio that already included its namesake email service the most used webmail provider and odnoklassniki the country second most popular social network corporate consolidation the tech sector poses problems for freedom expression and information everywhere however the primary driving force behind such consolidation not the companies own economic motivations but rather the government political aims the case mail these platforms were under the control owner ready and willing his immense wealth and power and that merger however was not the end the kremlin corporate takeovers instrument control the country tech giants yandex which addition operating most used search engine maintains aggregator that the single most popular source the internet and therefore has similarly been but yandex did not directly result these tactics instead the most proximate cause was the threat legislation that would limit prohibit foreign ownership tech_companies this case the relevant legislation was directly intended pressure yandex into corporate restructuring evidenced the fact that the legislation was introduced during sberbank takeover attempt and then withdrawn after yandex voluntarily restructured other legislation however has constrained the activities companies number ways going beyond ownership the government surveillance system known the acronym sorm has infrastructure since the with updates implemented capture more internet and mobile phone communications technology evolved companies have little ability push sorm gives the fsb the capability and the legal right collect private companies those companies knowledge law allowing internet oversight agency roskomnadzor order the blocking websites supposedly engaged criminal activity censor political speech leaving publishers and users blocked sites legal recourse most recently the yarovaya and sovereign internet laws which entered into force and respectively have and undermined any remaining legal technical capacity that they might have protect user privacy surveillance supply users with uncensored information outside the country all this leads grim conclusion barring dramatic political reforms the tech business sector can no_longer source independent action behalf free internet and russians seeking the internet for private communications and uncensored information have turn elsewhere the outlook for international companies while certainly more optimistic also less clear moscow goals when comes international technology companies those incorporated other countries but operating are quite similar those pursues with domestic firms authorities want maximize surveillance potential disrupt any possibility domestic political unrest result those companies content services and continue projecting disinformation through the internet recent battles over localization the mandated storage certain kinds within borders exemplify the kremlin desire maximize its own surveillance potential through foreign companies like authoritarian governments that viewed the internet free information flows threat regime security moscow that companies with citizens store locally firms could maintain copies the elsewhere but the itself had sit servers within the broad legal and political jurisdiction the security services described above recent years companies like facebook and twitter have seemingly just these orders and continued paying the trivial court ordered but pressures are likely grow putin further moves cement state control over storage fit into broader picture government efforts centralize internet flows designed the internet inception prioritize fast and reliable delivery above all else enable more effective government management and surveillance though the process often purely technical the objectives are fundamentally political practice these measures allow the government surveil dissidents ensure the privacy citizen against perceived malicious foreign access and extend state information control the digital domain simultaneously justifying the kremlin other main goals this sphere disrupting the potential for political pluralism enabled foreign tech platforms and projecting the state own disinformation through those same vectors requires kind argumentative gymnastics the government has for years required foreign internet companies operating remove content deems false should companies not comply the kremlin has vested powers roskomnadzor initiate technical blocks those websites although these blocks are often evaded poorly implemented the government has still managed pressure foreign companies related the covid crisis this minimizes the presence state critical contradictory information online the same government propaganda outlets often have large presence major western platforms like twitter and youtube and officials anytime those firms action against state_controlled outlets these inherent contradictions the government approach international tech_companies the kremlin wants these companies operate but only the kremlin own terms pressures companies suppress free speech inside but howls when government messaging abroad met with wariness mean that there still space for international companies effect certain extent internet freedom for citizens this operating space however under constant threat the government and likely the site several major conflicts coming years international firms continue push against certain elements state internet control firms that have mostly resisted complying with localization rules have not indicated any changed willingness follow kremlin pressure though resistance this kind won apply every area online important not group different components internet control here content takedowns for example are domain internet control the covid pandemic where the government was quite successful getting social_media companies their platforms within that officials deemed false second the struggle maintain free internet increasingly defined technical dimensions the government june decided telegram the encrypted messaging app essentially lacked the technical capacity block ironically this comprises certain kind payback for none other than pavel durov telegram creator who since losing and fleeing has built his messaging app into the world most popular the sovereign internet law that came into force for developing pernicious technical censorship capabilities perhaps most ominously the ability selectively censor content international social_media platforms while maintaining plausible deniability also required domestic internet companies centralize their architecture authorities could potentially cut off the internet the rest the world the event security incident broadly defined thus incumbent supporters internet freedom continue developing anti censorship technology and maintain the kind technical edge that has allowed telegram continue operating compromising surveillance censorship full disclosure the authors this article works for company that

believe this apply not only but globally too energy economists forecast that demand for gas continue grow particularly asia more countries draw line burning coal which emits almost double the carbon dioxide gas but demand for gas which met state gas monopoly gazprom could fall below levels the end the decade according novak also planned become global player the hydrogen economy producing and transporting the clean burning alternative traditional fossil fuel gas hydrogen can produced either using renewable energy split water molecules process known electrolysis splitting off the carbon dioxide gas through pyrolysis novak was able both and was also developing technology capture the carbon emissions created during hydrogen production offer genuinely green gas its customers using existing gas transport channels all this has been quite expensive far but believe that just like with the renewable energy sources which determine the pace hydrogen adoption put briefly can produce hydrogen and deliver consumers can also export the hydrogen production technologies novak pursuing hydrogen production would safeguard fossil fuel economy while helping reduce emissions worldwide but environmental groups carbon action tracker have nonetheless branded climate plans the emissions targets set through the paris agreement are set against levels which for marked its highest emissions

and true that over some areas its hold has weakened loss ukraine undeniable and serious however the current ructions not mark decline but demonstrate rather the opposite working settlements for nagorno_karabakh and belarus and doing according its own principles meanwhile the west lacks workable leverage over either issue appear the foot misunderstands its aims assuming that nagorno_karabakh stands unconditionally behind armenia its collective security treaty organisation ally whose control nagorno_karabakh azerbaijan relies military support also wrong assume that belarus moscow stands fully behind alyaksandr lukashenka the authoritarian leader who has declared his friendship towards though not always lived fact moscow quite tired lukashenka faced behaviour and would like see change minsk might also accept some change nagorno_karabakh happens moscow terms at_least terms understandable moscow true aim these neighbourhood conflicts not particular sides personalities but defend the principles values wants delegitimise bottom revolutions means transferring power also wants signal that western interventionism with its promotion democracy and normative approach are unfruitful general and unwelcome particular what playing out essentially the same philosophy that guided intervention syria and judged against these criteria moscow doing enough at_least the moment moscow wants delegitimise bottom revolutions means arrange transfers power belarus for instance moscow might backing lukashenka for but reality already working his replacement this process some lukashenka have some over the terms his exit recent meeting held with opposition figures jail was probably this process svitlana tsikhanouskaya though the opposition_leader based lithuania and the likely real winner the rigged election has probably been prescribed the role bystander moscow and has europe the start moscow has shunned all european calls for due procedure respect for human_rights and mediation the osce vladimir_putin last_week encapsulated his country position though somewhat hypocritically when did not interfere what was happening belarus and expect else interfere either should stirring this conflict promote their own interests and impose any decisions the belarusian people nagorno_karabakh different type conflict ethnic territorial kind and the onslaught fighting with azerbaijan emboldened turkish support might suggest that facing rival power its neighbourhood but for moscow the advantage having the west out still outweighs the nuisance having turkey moscow knows ankara and has learned work with the capitals are far being allies their goals the middle_east often stand direct opposition each_other but both realise they each_other they cannot achieve their aims some acquiescence the other and most importantly the turkish government motivated goals that the kremlin eyes are rational strengthening its power home enhancing its leverage abroad and pursuing economic and security interests lacks any western style rule centric approach and instead subscribes worldview that moscow understands azerbaijan too has pursued its foreign_policy challenging philosophical standpoint historical narratives though times has been odds with moscow this why might more relaxed than expected though its armenian ally trouble have reasons help its ally armenia but has reason all punish azerbaijan which has been example model behavior among the former soviet states far concerned carnegie scholar alexander baunov nagorno_karabakh again moscow that has brought the warring sides together and arranged for ceasefire though admittedly shaky the western members the contact group have largely been europeans have tried different ways influence the situation belarus lithuania for instance has positioned itself the moral high ground arranged public shows solidarity with the belarusian opposition and called for harsh sanctions against the regime france has dialogue with putin trying get the latter accept osce mediation collectively leaders made great efforts august signal moscow their restraint and desire not geopoliticise the conflict the hope that moscow would mirror the position thus allowing for armenian style political transition with geopolitical contest all avail after adopting wait and see position for weeks after the election moscow made its mind and embarked strategy transition that saves some face for lukashenka deepens leverage the country brings power leader acceptable moscow keeps both the west and the osce arm length and most importantly demonstrates that popular revolution not effective way transfer power can imagine scenarios under which moscow could reconsider its approach change strategy and reach out the lithuania based opposition but all these would stem developments inside belarus itself such strikes that paralyse the country the regime splitting and crumbling rather_than something the west does the lesson for the west clear enough

been unheard mark the beginning organized moderate alternative putin however the reality far more complex the liberal democratic party which furgal and his allies belong far that moderate movement

instead while those taking the street have vented frustrations the kremlin their complaints appear less about domestic policy than regional autonomy the scion prominent khabarovsk family furgal local credentials were key his popular support protestor pointed out normally the governors are sent the region moscow but furgal was different helped his arrest and the appointment mikhail degtyarev moscow

terrorist attack colour revolutions the georgian war the economic depression the mumbai attack the crimean referendum and its aftermath and the current covid pandemic therefore worth reflecting the decades seemingly positive bilateral engagement between india and important analyse how the agreement signed has played role the continuum ensuring the mutual understanding peaceful cooperation and reliability between the strategic partners this also opportunity critically evaluate the magnitude our strategic relationship and the changes the foreign_policy priorities since given the current global context the key question how prepared are india and for insulating the strategic_partnership amid the challenges the post pandemic world the declaration strategic_partnership was signed when the momentum the bilateral_relations between india and post_soviet collapse had fatigued due several factors but the most crucial factor them all was the renewal the the renewed treaty had almost written off the bilateral engagement clarified that was no_longer willing any defence commitment during the any external military threat india key security clause article that constituted the very core the indo soviet treaty the strategic_partnership treaty signed gave lease life restored india relations respectable levels both the countries realised the develop multifaceted bilateral cooperation all possible spheres defence energy space nuclear science and technology etc india strategic_partnership with since then has been unique intense and substantive ways mainly the treaty led the high level political interactions through annual bilateral summits key feature the agreement foster extensive collaboration and dynamism the partnership the twenty annual bilateral summits held far between india and have particular seen major agreements and initiatives undertaken strengthen the partnership higher levels additionally the bilateral ties were further elevated with the signing the arguably the partnership between the countries has been successfully reflected instances regional and global platforms general assembly referendum against for its accession crimea and unequivocal support india the kashmir issue are few cases point regarding strategic_partnership sensitive spheres cooperation between india and defence cooperation continues the major boosters for engagement between the countries india has acknowledged contribution assisting the former military power projection and preserving its national_security interests although recent times there downgrading the purchase defence equipment india the cooperation this sphere has been unassailable given that has progressed buyer seller relations joint research development and production high end technology transfer that has encouraged india quest for indigenous defence capabilities the induction ins vikramaditya the joint production brahmos missile india defence cooperation has achieved capacities through acquisitions and joint development fact resurgence military power recent times conducive india domestic initiatives such the india project the finalising the despite the threat imposition caatsa sanctions has shown india predictable resistance external pressures given its historical ties with indo nuclear cooperation constitutes important element our strategic_partnership the kudankulam nuclear power plant knpp has become the biggest success stories india cooperation unit and unit start commercial operation the process for reactor buildings units and have already begun with the construction nuclear power plants planned india nuclear cooperation has indeed reached heights india and bangladesh signed trilateral agreement march for the construction npp rooppur bangladesh has been another major element the strategic_partnership since export oriented energy country aim leverage its energy card with india import oriented energy market india interests the arctic for instance especially energy resources are crucial aspect for india growing energy security needs this seen great step towards strengthening india energy cooperation the bilateral partnership which has global strategic connotation has seen both the countries promote the idea building multipolar world order and changing the global financial structure this regard both india and have envisaged promoting harmonious global order based international law and collective decision making that includes developing countries and not monopolised developed countries alone india and along with other players such china have succeeded establishing non western organisations such brics and sco the member states have within their capabilities and limitations established mechanisms that address economic and strategic interests such the development bank while brics and sco have become tools political signalling issues related global affairs there however exist asymmetries among the member states with regard economic growth performance distribution resources and military strength additionally although china member such multilateral organisations the individual level beijing has exercised assertive posturing that has caused concern india this can seen its irrational border claims and actions the indian ocean region the role especially during the crisis between india and china therefore anticipated non partisan and meaningful when the treaty strategic_partnership was signed the world was the brink war terrorism after the terrorist attacks the world trade centre both india and their respective level joined the bandwagon the global war terror both parties bilateral partners which have been victims terrorist attacks voiced their interests and concerns combating terrorism and related activities india and have therefore cooperated bilateral and multilateral levels for instance india and also share the mutual interest preventing the proliferation weapons mass destruction and their possible acquisition terrorist groups while both india and assert their distinctive identity world politics respectively the strategic_partnership has seen close coordination foreign_policy interests wide range international and regional issues both countries firmly believe that intensification the indo strategic_partnership can help respond the challenges thrown global changes more effective way while both india and have diverging approach the indo pacific narrative cannot deny that the countries understand the for accordance with the universally accepted principles international law this includes combating piracy sea and providing humanitarian aid during natural disasters the countries have shown keen interest restoring peace and stability afghanistan eurasian integration has been key priority the india strategic_partnership understands that its quest for greater eurasia india vital player for its huge market potential economic growth performance military strength and enhanced position international affairs strategic_partnership between india and since the soviet_era and has continued remain today fact both countries have agreed expand their relations the aerospace sphere area traditional cooperation for decades more than joint projects involving scientists and research institutes both countries have been undertaken within the framework various initiatives since while critically evaluating the decades strategic_partnership between india and tempting compare india strategic_partnership with other major global players and the strategic_partnership that shares with the realities the dynamic nature international relations have definitely posed challenge the partnership the pursuing all alignment foreign_policy has caused certain level discomfort the bilateral_relations india growing proximity with the and compromised defence cooperation with china and mending ties with pakistan recent times has caused anxiety the strategic_partnership between india and possible inference that can draw the constant comparison the current india partnership with that the nostalgia indo soviet ties but needs bear mind that compared the strategic_partnership that both india and share with other major players there are limitations and shrouded with lack trust india defence relations with for instance yet any substantive development joint production and restrictiveness about its technology compared generosity sharing defence technology and relations with pakistan eclipsed with lack trust and understanding for china relations there growing speculation possible role reversal the partnership given china growth global politics recent times however there are few stumbling blocks india defence cooperation especially the shifting trends partnership for example defence engagement between and china current cooperation with china has emerged exclusively includes cooperation sensitive fields such strategic missile defence hypersonic technology and the construction nuclear submarines with allowing for the latter equipped with similar and more advanced capabilities china major security concern for india hence given the way collaboration advanced future weapon systems quantum technology and artificial intelligence should enhanced further between india and indo relations are undoubtedly the cusp litmus test nonetheless the strategic_partnership should see the future asia beyond the and china factors and both india and can play decisive role promoting their mutual interests the region the rapid and uncontrollable spread covid the past seven months has impacted the global order and the interconnected systems reflecting the spirit the partnership times crisis also welcomed india goodwill gesture send medical supplies help fight the virus critics have often pointed out that the strategic_partnership yet achieve its full potential given the fact that some the spheres cooperation continue remain obsolete for instance the economic relations additionally given nearly years diplomatic relations soft power capabilities cultural diplomacy academic exchange programmes and labour migration are imperceptible status trade and investment remains the weakest link our strategic_partnership and falls far short our potential which unfortunately not commensurate with our high level political cooperation post the announcement the strategic agreement which largely promotes the strengthening economic relations between india and the trade cart received required upgrade potential areas trade have been explored which include trade and investment energy nuclear science and technology pharmaceuticals steel diamonds fertilizers infrastructure heavy engineering and food products exploring economic prosperity sustainable development and free movement people information knowledge ideas and greater institutional links has also become crucial fact both countries have set target each_other country the also heartening that options are being explored further expand the domain economic cooperation eurasian integrity regional cooperation free trade agreements connectivity and trade corridors have gained the utmost importance the annual bilateral summits the past decades the countries have also set mechanisms such commissions for example irigc tec the international north south transport corridor and the eurasian economic union which have emerged immediate priority areas for strong economic cooperation between the countries the far_east another region for potential economic engagement india presence the eastern economic forum eef aimed developing trade commerce investment railway infrastructure steel plants defence space ports and shipping india has successfully participated the annual eef with prime_minister for the development the far_east other than these developments our economic ties are focused exploring the potential sub regional cooperation sub regional cooperation has emerged the prospective areas cooperation and regional connectivity add further impetus the economic cooperation between india and the key goal cement and cooperation between the states and union territories the republic india and provinces the federation further bolster india far ambitions four indian states led the commerce and industry minister india piyush goyal visited vladivostok explore the opportunities and potential business business cooperation the far with the introduction the the world the for both india and tap the potentials agricultural sector crucial regional connectivity needs due attention hence the successful execution alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors such chennai vladivostok needs prompt engagement the major impact the pandemic has prompted countries explore alternate market destinations and shifts the business environment the crisis has opened opportunities for countries such india and reposition themselves the global supply chain with its efforts attract investment the far_east and india with its huge manpower and existing available manufacturing units should endorsed potential and suitable alternatives for manufacturing instead developed nations despite the seemingly successful bilateral_relations between india and the strategic community incomplete there shortfall establishing strong people people engagement since the soviet_collapse bilateral_relations have seen minimal cultural diplomacy academic exchange and labour migration perhaps vistas cooperation could explored promote soft power capabilities between the countries such cinema which has always been the most successful foreign_policy tools enhance cultural exchange and people people contact between countries the film industry great medium for spreading narratives and india movies have immense following impact the minds the population india and collaborated movie production during the soviet_era however the trend did not last due the fall the soviet_union among other factors the right for both india and collaborate the entertainment industry especially through joint production movies and creating powerful narratives related bilateral cooperation india and must concentrate more the content the movie rather_than joint production alone for the audience the content matters more than the producer moreover can have everlasting impact the minds the indian population the content projects character aiding collaborating with indian protagonist movie bringing down antagonist also the indian movie industry always the look for exotic locations foreign lands hence order attract the indian movie industry could look into easing travel and other shooting permissions within its jurisdictions such effort would not only bring closer industry ties but also able showcase the and its rich culture the indian population thereby acting window promotion for tourism regarding geopolitical realignment today the global community seeking pragmatic the role india and crucial their efforts diffuse the multipolar world system this also relevant for regional alliances actively engage politically and economically which should help bilateral_relations between the countries elevate higher pedestal post pandemic world order the current global situation has given rise some daunting challenges for the partnership once again some the are linked the disruptions being caused the international order traditional and non traditional threats such climate change secure communication challenges etc nurturing hopes for stability and prosperity eurasia the post pandemic world bilateral_relations between india and and their proactive role regional mechanisms such sco eurasian economic union eaeu and india china ric are viewed integral this construct regional connectivity needs due attention the successful execution alternative economic corridors and maritime trade corridors conclusion the signing the milestone agreement was the outcome developments that took place bilateral_relations between india and after the fall the soviet_union the main aim the agreement was elevate the partnership level cooperation and put speculations and uncertainties the relationship rest over the past twenty years relations the partnership has seen ups and downs nonetheless this has not allowed any major damage that could impact lead any serious conflict interest between the countries having that the coveted relations built over the years cannot taken for granted this regard apart political elites and bureaucrats playing crucial role enhancing the relations academicians artists students the research community tanks and educational institutions should contribute forming the true essence the partnership the youth particular draw inspiration each_other rich history and cultural relevance carrying forward the vision for term partnership the engagement both countries the international ecosystem the post pandemic world has become more relevant has given rise challenges and opportunities the strategic_partnership between india and nevertheless needs insulate the mutual interests challenges that emerge within and external factors perhaps the for reality check and serious introspection crucial the challenges are only set grow given the dynamism international relations our partner published despite

going work very hard nonpartisan run between the and the inauguration and finally should mention listeners that this episode going run the after the election but that you and are taping the friday before the election you and have idea whats going happen election people should just that theyre theyre listening our conversation and thats actually good thing for our conversation because what want the end the get your sense what going face the president who sworn january matter who that person happens michael_morrell before get the individual issues that want walk through with you love ask you why you decided write the book that you did you obviously could have written very different kind book and sure that there were publishers who were encouraging you that but you chose not that you chose write very serious look the threats and challenges that face nation why did you the route that you did gen_mcmaster michael thank_you served the army for thirty four_years transitioned what only second career adult life made out probably quite predictably mission statement for myself and that was second career try deepen our understanding the most crucial challenges face way better inform the american people about foreign_policy and national_security issues and with the hope that learn more about these challenges that face can demand better demand better foreign_policy our elected leaders but then also hope that the book and the work that doing the book help bring americans together right because dont any these issues should partisan nature what hoping for that deeper understanding these challenges face and what should our common commitment try build better future for generations come help bring our country together at_least foreign_policy and national_security issues michael_morrell what are the main themes the book what you want readers walk away remembering gen_mcmaster what are the themes that runs through the book this idea strategic narcissism this the reasons why our competence our ability compete at_least the post cold_war period has been significantly diminished and strategic narcissism mean our tendency define the world only relation and then assume that what decide decide not decisive achieving favorable outcome and course you michael with your experience with intelligence this flawed because its self referential and doesnt acknowledge you the degree which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future the book then argument argument for cultivating with friend and great historian zachary shore has termed strategic empathy and this effort effort understand better what drives and constrains the other especially adversaries rivals and enemies and what drives and constrains the other often times ideology and emotion and aspirations the theme the book that also important effort understand how the recent past produced the present the step making projection into the future the book argument for the understanding history and appreciation for the complex causality events and focus understanding these crucial challenges were facing the perspective the perspective others michael_morrell you thats the thats the main jobs the intelligence community right give our decision makers the point view the other guy the guy sitting across the table you the guy sitting across the battlefield you but whats the other guy thinking what are his constraints what are his interests and thats extraordinarily important right gen_mcmaster course its not idea goes sun tzu but its started neglect the importance this especially the post cold_war period period that describe period over optimism over optimism that led complacency and bit hubris and this over optimism was large measure set set for significant disappointments the thousands disappointments course associated with the mass murder attacks september but also the unanticipated length and difficulty wars afghanistan and iraq and course followed financial crisis and was the thousands that this emotional impetus behind our foreign_policy shifted overoptimism pessimism and maybe tendency under appreciate the risks and costs action tendency underappreciate the risks and costs inaction and that strategic narcissism the cause really both cases michael_morrell you the other thing that strikes when you talk about the importance history always thought sitting deputies meetings that would have been incredibly valuable actually few minutes and every deputies meetings principals meetings talk about the history the issue just review how you got point point and never did that multiple administrations which served but always thought that that would have been really valuable gen_mcmaster michael youre absolutely right about that ill tell you the the great gifts had before earlier career was the opportunity read things study and write history and the book wrote was which story about how and why vietnam became american war and the lessons learned the study that history was that was important understand problems and challenges holistically before leaping into action when came national_security adviser did best at_least avoid making the same mistakes and put place principle small group framing session thats mouthful but developed these strategies for the most crucial challenges were facing began with this framing session that was organized five page paper that included only really the description the challenge how got where are bit the history and then inventory our vital interests that were stake view that challenge through the lens those vital interests and draft overarching goals and more specific objectives followed assumptions assumptions about the degree which and like minded partners have agency influence over this challenge then inventory obstacles progress and opportunities that could exploit and thats then had discussion about the nature the challenge the policy coordinating committee which you are the real workers who are going work this project theyre listening theyre getting theyre hearing the cabinet level discussion about the nature the problem and then refinement once that the meeting was done then shifted discussion what are your ideas how integrate the elements national power and efforts like minded partners overcome these obstacles and exploit these opportunities then they got hear the treasury secretary what have have economic and financial tools available but those ought combined with diplomacy and maybe law_enforcement efforts and then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with that hope thats process that sustained dont successor hung onto have resurrected some point deemed useful future national_security adviser michael_morrell michael_morrell today have with mcmaster senior_fellow both stanford universitys hoover institution and its graduate school business career army officer and national_security adviser president trump what love through the individual issues and what like just throw out get you frame whats the threat challenge that face whats the history how did get here whats our interest thats stake and how you nation about dealing with lets start with the big lets start with the big enchilada china gen_mcmaster china great example strategic narcissism work and especially this assumption that clung for too that china having been welcomed into the international order would play the rules would liberalize its economy and prospered would liberalize its form government course thats not true thats not true because undervalue the degree which emotions and ideology drive and constrain the chinese communist_party and what would argue battlegrounds that the party driven mainly fear fear losing its exclusive grip power and associated ambition the ambition achieve national rejuvenation for china center stage the world again after the tragedy they portrayed the century humiliation that combination fear and aspiration that driving the partys effort extend and tighten its exclusive grip power internally this why there are over million people concentration camps xinjiang and theres campaign cultural genocide ongoing this why the party extending their repressive arm hong kong and perfecting their technologically enabled orwellian surveillance police state this what were seeing and then what more troubling the parties effort export its authoritarian mercantilist model through number strategies that aim create servile relationships with countries and then ultimately through economic means the growth the peoples liberation armys capabilities establish areas privacy across the pacific region that exclude the united_states and then challenged the united_states the free world globally china succeeds mean our world less free less prosperous and less safe the stakes are high and its past for recognize the compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form aggression that the parties engaged michael_morrell what would effective china strategy look like you gen_mcmaster the trump administration gets credit for anything should get credit for fundamental shift our policy toward china that was overdue and that fundamentally sound and this the idea that have compete and was under the strategy cooperation and engagement that the chinese communist_party was emboldened competition doesnt lead confrontation fact quite the opposite and have returned arenas competition involving countering more effectively chinas campaign sustained industrial espionage against countering range chinas unfair trade and economic practices doing large measure through effective international cooperation for example establishing better standards for infrastructure investment internationally the law_enforcement actions and investigations that have gone against apt the main hacking arm the chinese communist_party have been very effective combined with sanctions and other actions against the aggressive arms the party but really the most important thing for and argue this chapter battlegrounds entitled turning weakness into strength what the chinese communist_party sees sources weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strengths what does the party fear the party fears that the people the chinese people might want have how theyre governed should strengthen our democratic processes the party fears rule law should strengthen rule law the united_states and with countries that are working strengthen rule law their countries the party fears freedom press freedom the expression strengthen our authoritative sources information and recognize that investigative journalism great counter some these pernicious strategies that the parties are pursuing that defensive but more introspective and trying maintain our competitive advantages michael_morrell this intelligence matters michael_morrell were talking with former national_security adviser mcmaster how you about gen_mcmaster significant threat because putin again examining the assumptions previous policies putin not going become like the grinch christmas eve right his heart not going get too big the size gets bigger and hes not going decide maybe the future does lie more with the west and treat the united_states and europe and others differently putin driven sense honor lost after the breakup the soviet_union also driven this associated desire restore national greatness hes also cognizant though the fact that cannot compete with this our own terms and what his theory victory drag all down and then the last man standing and the means that hes using this describe the chinese approach cooption coercion and concealment and alliteration the chapters campaign disruption disinformation and denial try disrupt disrupt our effective governance disrupt economically and economic coercion when can such has done europe effectively and with energy dependence then deny his most egregious acts especially the sustained campaign cyber enabled information warfare against which designed polarize pit against each_other reduce our confidence who are people and our democratic institutions and principles and processes dangerous threat for for these reasons and the best way counter the step pull the curtain this activity educate ourselves about less susceptible information not our own worst enemies both political parties instances have because they compromise and they compromised our principles score some partisan political points and doing themselves vulnerable disinformation and propaganda michael_morrell then what about raising the cost him doing this that option here terms deterring him gen_mcmaster absolutely this what advocated for battlegrounds that have impose costs the kremlin putin that exceed those that factors the beginning his decision making process was last really oval office meeting was the that president trump decided impose significant costs response the attempted poisoning murder sergei skripal and his daughter with with banned military grade nerve agent and act that put thousands citizens risk and was that that occasion that expelled you over undeclared intelligence agents that hits putin where matters because these are agents that were critical his sustained campaign subversion against and impose significant costs additional costs through sanctions and other actions the closing the san francisco consulate you michael was major intelligence collection platform for the russians here silicon valley and the bay area that was significant and that sent strong message after navalnys poisoning like see the same thing you and hes infiltrating more little green men into belarus and continues enable the serial episodes mass homicide that the syrian civil war support hawthornes way perpetuating violence libya michael_morrell michael morell

your podcasts lets talk about north_korea give your sense north_korea gen_mcmaster thanks michael course its important for recognize going right that north_korea the only communist hereditary dictatorship the world and the nature the kim family regime that have into account when were considering the danger that the regime poses the world does possess the most destructive weapons earth the kim family regime driven mainly this drive remain power course known the hermit kingdom gulag state that fears any kind opening the world and regime that across three generations dictators has been committed unifying the korean peninsula under the called red banner and look north koreas pursuit the most destructive weapons earth have at_least open the possibility that wants those weapons coerce the united_states off the peninsula the step the forcible reunification the peninsula and course that would that would the form destructive war gen_mcmaster its also important for recognize that highly unlikely that north_korea wants nuclear weapons just deter north_korea already had very significant deterrence capability with its conventional weapons and the fact that its thousands artillery pieces are within the range seoul south korea and then also its important recognize that every act aggression the korean peninsula since the north invaded the south june has been initiated the north the other aspect this problem michael that very important consider that north_korea gets the weapon recognized nuclear power like who doesnt get after that right this japan starts have conversation with south korea the way north_korea never met weapon didnt try sell somebody excluding its nuclear program until the israeli defense force bombed that facility its very dangerous its dangerous because the ideology that drives this regime its warped ideology this the zushi ideology which has turned deprivation into sign virtue and racial superiority and the north korean people have gone through generations brainwashing this big problem michael that the approach that place the strategy maximum pressure its the best course action have test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince kim jong that safer the weapons than with them important for whoever sworn january that they recognize that should not repeat the failed pattern previous efforts not allow north_korea draw into negotiations with act aggression and with the demands big payoff front just for the privilege talking with them not again engage drawn out negotiations that delivers weak agreement that immediately breaks again michael_morrell youve something here that really important because the conventional wisdom that wants these weapons for deterrence right that hes worried about attacking him but youre arguing that its more than that that this gets the heart what north_korea has always wanted which reunify the peninsula which really important point here that changes how you about how you have deal with him gen_mcmaster this argument michael for strategic empathy right view these complex challenges the perspective the other and unless you that youre susceptible mirror imaging and course research for the book you that sensitized this was the run the vietnam war where some those who were planning the vietnam strategy development the strategy actually referred the reasonable man theory english common law and assumed that chi minh would respond the theoretical reasonable man would respond taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played driving and constraining the north vietnamese leadership michael_morrell you the end the its possible convince him that would better off that would more secure these weapons gen_mcmaster its possible and the reason its possible because weve never really put maximum pressure the north and have this opportunity thanks really the tremendous work ambassador nikki haley when she was the you michael these security council sanctions north_korea are unprecedented and reach the key though enforce them course the key country that needs enforce them china and china doesnt enforce them china continues complicit with illicit financial flows into and out the country continue provide energy and other materials the north that are limited these sanctions then its for consider secondary sanctions and maybe chinese financial institutions gen_mcmaster see the smuggling coal and the transshipment coal and oil and fuel that under article the president could article authority interdict those ships you michael this something cant really talk about there are other means putting pressure the north that havent done yet have at_least test the thesis because the alternatives are bleak either accepting north_korea nuclear power and coping with that threat war right that would very costly its worth pursuing michael_morrell still have more discuss with general mcmaster and right with our final segment michael_morrell were with more intelligence matters michael_morrell our guest mcmaster senior_fellow both stanford universitys hoover institution and its graduate school business sir let ask you about another tough iran gen_mcmaster iran what tell the story michael have view the problem iran with fundamental considerations foremost our minds the the ideology the revolution and how that drives iranian leadership and the iranian leadership the supreme leader and the guardian council and the islamic revolutionary guards corps have this fantasy that the reformers the republicans within iraq are going prevail they lost the revolutionaries are charge the hardliners are charge and whenever they put this forward the shop window minister zarif their foreign minister president rouhani thats all youre getting the shop window that ideology drives the iranian regime continue its four decade proxy_war against the great satan the united_states the little satan israel the arab monarchies and the west broadly and have consider the ideology the regime and and this proxy_war gen_mcmaster what argue for the book force the iranian regime choice you can either treated like normal nation you can continue wage this proxy_war support terrorist organizations and keep the middle_east enmeshed this perpetual state sectarian civil war the choice yours and impose that choice what should not lift the arms embargo the regime what should not lift any the sanctions fact should impose the costs the regime constrain the resources they have available continue their proxy wars against but then also ultimately maybe convince the iranian people that they ought have government place and not talking about like regime change but government place that shifts away its permanent hostility the united_states israel and the west thats the only path that see forward our policies ought aim effect that change the regimes permanent hostility and until does any agreement with them cant trusted and any agreement with them that allows them escape making that choice like the iran nuclear deal did our disadvantage michael_morrell you dont see the regime changing policy its own you that has forced internally the iranian people that fair gen_mcmaster michael iran its important keep considerations mind crafting strategy toward iran all that its the ideology the regime that drives their hostile behavior toward and have recognize that its the supreme leader its the guardian council its islamic revolutionary guards corps who are charge right there was struggle you across the history iran since the revolution between the republicans and the revolutionaries hey the revolutionaries won and and have recognize that the second consideration that this regime has waged four decade proxy_war against the great satan the little satan israel the arab monarchies and the west generally have craft our strategy recognition this regimes permanent hostility course the best way approach the title the chapter forcing the regime choice either being responsible nation and then being treated such suffering the consequences and this why its very important keep the arms embargo place its very important keep the sanctions place the regime the short term reduce the resources has available wage this proxy_war and the term hopefully convince the iranian people demand change the nature the government such that ceases permanent hostility michael_morrell okay islamic extremism its waned bit the threat but its still there west africa the middle_east south asia southeast asia how you about that problem term gen_mcmaster the reason that havent had another attack the scale the most devastating terrorist attack history september our tremendous intelligence professionals our diplomats our military whos been engaged against this threat jihadist terrorist organizations since what concerned about michael that these groups are more dangerous today than they were maybe september and thats because course those who committed the mass murder attacks against were the mujahideen alumni the resistance the soviet occupation afghanistan the qaida alumni the isis alumni the lashkar taiba alumni are orders magnitude greater and they have access more and more destructive capabilities and the reason weve been safe because weve been engaged and have this narrative ending endless wars and disengaging what americans that are engaged can enable others bear the brunt this fight mean this disengagement afghanistan tragedy the way that weve gone about this should recognize the sacrifices our longest war and particular that our courageous servicemen soldiers gave their lives for our country our security this but have also recognize that afghan soldiers and police die defending the freedoms that theyve enjoyed since the defeat the taliban removal the taliban power that sustained argument the american people for engagement with this problem jihadist terrorism because dont michael remember when after the embassy bombings fired few cruise missiles and called right that didnt work out michael_morrell the last issue want ask you about venezuela which you care about understanding that when you arrived the white_house you were going over the issues and you kind stumbled venezuela and hey you whats going there that doesnt look like were paying attention this talk about venezuela and why its important gen_mcmaster its immensely important because this humanitarian catastrophe venezuela its humanitarian catastrophe thats brought authoritarian regime that denying the venezuelan people how theyre governed when looked the problem and the nature the maduro regime and the chavista movement concluded that this was again corrupt government that using criminalized patronage networks effect control its people uses these motorcycle gangs and militias overwhelm any kind opposition ended the constitution whats should our goal our goal should work with others work with like minded countries effect restoration constitutional rule venezuela and that felt had pursue three objectives those objectives would try strengthen the opposition right help the opposition come together you saw that with the rise bolsonaro you who was really the people you hes not member the caracas polo club for example hes somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged significantly under chavez and maduro gen_mcmaster the second objective would for the people able attribute their grievances the government not blame the yankees you for example and the third related that would try galvanize really popular support for restoration constitutional government the measures put place were sound course they have proven inadequate and thought that economic sanctions would maybe have significant effect but the reason they havent had bigger effect theres huge black market illicit economy thats run maduro uses that sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gangs thugs who really prevent any real opposition gaining traction but proud what did this period worked very closely with partners especially the western hemisphere mexico under the foreign minister the great luis videgaray who was wonderful partner took leading role the work that did tryd get the organization american states and others more but was really the community like minded nations brazil colombia peru panama argentina worked very closely together this problem and remain committed trying effect restoration constitutional government venezuela michael_morrell youve been fantastic with your just want ask you more questions have couple minutes left quick here michael_morrell the that order deal with all these problems that youve talked about you healthy national_security toolkit healthy diplomacy healthy intelligence capabilities healthy military capabilities whats your assessment sort overall where are with our national_security toolkit gen_mcmaster were good shape thanks the extremely dedicated civil servants and military professionals intelligence professionals who have across our government but what needed more than anything higher degree what argue strategic competence and thats the ability integrate the elements national power that theyre applied way that are synergistic the whole greater than the sum the parts times get right but most often get wrong and our approach these complex problems fragmented its inconsistent its mentioned you based flawed assumptions about the nature the problem what would like see these days more concerted effort foster multinational cooperation write mean none these problems are solvable any country its very important for create the right venues for come together not only work discrete issue event together but really about these complex challenges frame them together and then apply our competitive advantages between our like minded countries that have synergistic effect and and that can build better future for generations come michael_morrell the last question anybody whos listened the podcast this point going wow that hard tough list wonder the end the youre optimistic you are pessimistic that were going get this right going forward gen_mcmaster michael optimistic about optimistic about emerge this triple crisis the pandemic the recession associated with and the divides our society laid bare george floyds murder and the protests and civil unrest that followed whats great about our democracy are self correcting the american people have how theyre governed they can demand better and the reason wrote the american people understand these challenges they demand better foreign_policy our elected leaders you our founders knew that our democracy was going require continuous nurturing its still true today and believe that have significant problems home but also have confront these challenges abroad because the covid pandemic that problems that develop abroad can only dealt with

president with experience more interest cutting deals than designing term strategy and unwillingness sit for intelligence briefings less discussion containing angry decaying plan compete with rising china battlegrounds its heart the mcmaster strategic plan that might have come fruition had worked for president who was interested strategic plans before walked into the west wing mcmaster was the closest thing the army had soldier scholar his book about vietnam was devastating account how the united_states had flawed decision making process that was largely based self deception ways battlegrounds the sequel seeking ask the question why not whether the united_states another moment protests the streets and bitter partisan divides losing its ability shape the world but the answers this are different mcmaster view the key his argument that america suffering what hans morgenthau called strategic narcissism mcmaster words the tendency view the world only relation the united_states and assume that the future course events depends primarily decisions plans hard argue with that premise every president comes office assuming that the world waiting for direction washington some countries are others are looking for power vacuums they can fill each its own way that been the story the past decades has emerged disrupter knowing that has neither the money nor the technology the united_states directly china has become builder why threaten cut undersea cables vladimir_putin submarine force does you can dominate global communications rob joyce official who worked for mcmaster the white_house cybersecurity coordinator the hurricane china climate change mcmaster realized that and devoted his the west wing writing national_security strategy that would reorient the united_states away nearly decades and toward countering moscow and beijing which called revisionist powers was impressive document unfortunately the president under whose name was published aides concede did not read battlegrounds expands the written strategy the the white_house has barely mentioned since was published and makes strong case for containing pushing chinese influence and using american leverage and allies confront iran and north_korea what washington needs mcmaster argues integrated approach that recognizes that the old tools that drove saddam hussein out kuwait when mcmaster served are pretty useless years later starts with the united_states and europe were ill prepared for toxic combination disinformation denial dependence and disruptive technologies recognition that what happened was not that america radar was off that the radar was never built fortunately has since been pieced together and the presidential contest everyone facebook twitter the united_states cyber_command has been pushing disinformation has been blocked clumsily at_least briefly unfortunately mcmaster boss was not board with this approach mcmaster notes president trump often improving relations with would good thing not bad thing while succumbing putin flattery and treating his criminal actions with dismissiveness and moral equivalency and course the repeated references the hoax which meant the president circle could discuss election interference dreading eruption triggered trump fear that the legitimacy the election was being questioned mcmaster never deals head with the fundamental problem that the administration had paper defensible strategy and the president kept undermining instead cites his top aide fiona hill who writes always warned that putin seeks divide americans and europeans should not divide themselves china the climate changer course immune containment strategies the old cold_war was largely military contest version military diplomatic economic and technological contest that change led misappraisal the challenge mcmaster points out succession administrations convinced themselves that over china would conform western built system trump

powers selling them controlled china technology huawei networks after mcmaster departed tiktok addictive app took the united_states decade and half understand the immensity the trojan horse had let how the united_states blindly let chinese giant gain ground while american firms exited the market but the reader yearns for mcmaster solution ban chinese technology maybe president trump trying but then china dominate percent more the world networks embrace industrial policy that win the market dealing with the biggest failures the trump administration iran and north_korea that mcmaster sounds the loudest alarms while was major critic president obama nuclear deal with tehran and criticizes obama aides for overlooking iran support terrorism and terrorist regimes reports that internally argued for staying inside the deal and using trump threats toss aside leverage but the president wouldn that chess moves ahead and dispensed with the whole deal month after mcmaster left fears that the united_states allies confront iran slip into the place are with other nuclear powers that washington once declared could never possess nuclear arms pakistan provides stark warning iran could become like pakistan today nuclear armed state which terrorists already enjoy support base the greatest threat humanity the coming decades lie the nexus between terrorists and the most destructive weapons earth north_korea course already has those weapons and lot more fuel for them than when the trump administration arrived with its threats fire and fury they were not turned over immediately was the president ego that got the way mcmaster knew that soon kim jong proposed summit the president would find historic meeting between north korean leader and president irresistible not single weapon missile has been dismantled but the sanctions regime tatters undercut and china which takes mcmaster question his are facing the modern enigma codes turns out the enigma this americans want the unrivaled power the global influence and the economic growth and freedom that come with the kind enjoyed with little challenge the end world war and then briefly after the collapse the soviet_union

pair conflicting resolutions the united_states and although the draft resolutions have been circulated among member states neither are yet final nor public the proposed resolution calls states wait until the current group governmental experts gge and oewg meetings are completed early before formally proposing process address cyber issues the contrast the draft resolution calls for oewg convened

and and this the seventh project that have funded over the last years important sign the cultural bonds between the united_states and very good you lucky that you prepared the good papers and are lucky course russians that this restored and ask you some questions about other cultural people people relations between and america like sisters cities program the business cooperation cooperation space arctic because there are lot dimensions coexistence rather only all the military and strategic ones konstantin you absolutely right and would you there are relations between the government and the government the federation whether strategic and military issues political issues and all how fraught those relations have been over the last several years particular but there broader relationship between the united_states and between our peoples cultural and educational exchanges business space the arctic and small topic that like emphasize but colleagues here the embassy are probably sick hearing talk about ice hockey which personal interest mine but those connections konstantin that are among the most significant that have and they are bond that keeps together when the political situation seems most dire and thing observed tenure here how the relationship between the united_states and has changed just professional lifetime you came mentioned earlier our conversation that visited st_petersburg was private citizen had great interest and history visited moscow what was then leningrad but visited the soviet_union then and visited leningrad not st_petersburg and you all that happened our relationship between our countries over the last years how things have changed the ups and downs what grown has been the cultural business all those ties between our peoples that have grown dramatically and that distinguishes this era that sort late soviet_era that grew the and when didn have those ties that keep together when the political sea gets choppy for example have more than businesses invested doing business here and that means russians and americans working together not just the bolshoi traveling york and performing york city you equivalent theatre company coming the united_states and performing here personal interaction between colleagues business and that significant and provides little more ballast for the relationship when the political seas can get choppy but those who are old enough with some perspective can look over the last three four decades and see how our relationship has changed our counterparts years the ambassador and your successor you sure they remarking too how things have changed since and the relationship between the united_states and remember those dark old days with you with ukraine crimea and syria and libya and nagorno_karabakh and belarus and election interference and cyber this and god knows what our successors are going talking about years but what the fact that have made the connections that made over the last years business the arts sports and entertainment more likely that positive outcome and more positive developments not just focused the negativity yeah you mentioned the amazing figure that thousand businesses are dealing with despite all the sanctions and all the risks connected with sanctions and our cooperation between military syria also exist and they exchange information really share your view that the infrastructure spheres interrelations good support these big politics and that you absolutely right that infrastructure something you mentioned konstantin sister city partnerships got large number this program that been existence for decades established and managed the government there official government relationship that involved here note sister cities international nonpartisan nonprofit which serves the national membership organization for individual sister cities counties and states across the united_states sister cities international was created president eisenhower white_house summit citizen diplomacy but independent nongovernmental organization end note but these sister city relationships you date into soviet times into the when the five sister city relationships happened and you got cities all across the united_states that are joined with cities across sarasota florida and vladimir for example burlington vermont and yaroslavl louisville kentucky and perm chicago and moscow and you small thing but important our relationship and also the link with business konstantin because what done here the embassy and colleagues the department commerce and our counterparts the ministry trade that have made connections business business connections with regions and cities the united_states because covid had this virtually but were planning trade mission texas texas companies and the government the state texas the yekaterinburg the ural region had because covid did virtually but was full event the government the state texas was involved the governor the state himself and making those types regional connections for business profitable way forward and spoken secretary ross our secretary commerce about this and that the secretary himself had phone call recently with trade minister manturov and that area where going continue pursue making those connections regionally not just government government very important because lot asymmetric information available regions people wants something but they lack adequate information thank_you for that effort yekaterinburg because our industrial number three number four city you have any plans for cooperation the arctic because arctic seems attract attention yes very relevant and timely topic our relationship konstantin because you over the chair the arctic council just few months and the arctic council very important institution that promotes this vital region zone cooperation free conflict and the council itself institution where can discuss sustainable development the environment protection and development indigenous peoples and shared interest the united_states course has huge chunk the arctic region within its northern border but the united_states canada the other members the countries that border the arctic region all have shared interest its development and its protection and colleagues washington and our embassy here have been engaged directly with the government with the ministry foreign affairs particular met with deputy foreign minister titov couple months ago talk about arctic cooperation and role assuming the chair the arctic council and those discussions have continued between our governments between washington and moscow and the pace interaction increase get closer when does assume the chair okay thank_you and the last question but our younger audience always interested about student exchange and with covid lot zoom classes have but still what number russians which are enrolled american universities and colleges terrific question and could guess off the top head but what going propose that get you with the precise figures for your publication note the latest open doors report shows that for the academic more than russians studied the not have the figures for current enrollment online programs end note but what would offer konstantin had participated virtual program that the united_states government that the embassy helped organize usually person bring over representatives colleges and universities the united_states and they come here moscow other cities and they available families students parents who are interested having student study the united_states because covid weren able that person did virtually but here the benefit though that there silver lining got more colleges and universities able participate virtually who wouldn have been able send either afford couldn send somebody participate program moscow what that meant was that the students and their families that were interested and participated got wide variety wider variety colleges and universities presented and interested recruiting them study the united_states and you yourself studied penn won embarrass you saying how years_ago was but was out college myself then neither youngster anymore but you yourself can testify the benefit study abroad and getting another country and seeing how their education system works and number colleagues here the embassy have studied institutions language culture key component and has been for and really looking encourage that and always fun meet russians who have studied the united_states and compare notes about their experience with our expectations and these were these were remarks and wasn just trying flatter the participants fact that hear colleges and universities that students are among the most desired are the most serious hardworking and just great additions the student body which isn this surprise for those who aspire important our relationship the broader relationship between our peoples and certainly want encourage and doing all can the face the covid pandemic sure that those relationships continue and that they don wither diminish just because not able have person interaction hope that have large number students traveling the united_states and enriching our schools and our campuses you did the philadelphia thank_you and personally very grateful you for supporting this students exchange because you you live the country difficult influence you pushing any misperceptions engage you witch hunt and helps understand the nature people and since years_ago returned philadelphia you keep this interest towards america read every american papers read american books watch american television watched the debate tonight put down notes who what what the argument that and this something very profound our sympathy and relations and desire improve because belong that society and always openly every level that believe that good relations with america can benefit people medicine science culture sports engineering business benefit could rather selfish this point view but beneficial not hostile and wish that you your position ambassador put all your efforts pursue the line these dark dark days covid and the distraction regular relationships you right and had great experience few months ago and can add all the categories you listed law and the legal profession spoke law students was probably couple hundred was virtual virtual event did zoom some other electronic means which colleagues are better able describe and function than just sit front the camera and talk but what was fascinating was for those students was the american that they really had chance engage with their young lives and had lot common talked about our legal education some their professors were the call and got share few comments about law professors and what was like joining profession what their expectations were and just example our lives both experienced this russians and americans there are things that have common whether engineers ballet dancers hockey players authors lawyers people are people and the more that can have these exchanges trade experiences explore how our systems are different and how they similar breaks down stereotypes and just makes things between our countries makes the relationship stronger and makes more difficult for political winds blow the relationship really dangerous direction the more understand each_other the better able overcome some these differences which would separate yeah thank_you ambassador you what noticed that what you talked today was actually about the substance american relations because usually lot experts view the america and vice versa only means solve some others country problems like solve problem north_korea iran afghanistan here but never table which belongs all spheres which you mentioned just belong and america every aspect and most valuable this relation that have the body mutual interest and thank_you for understanding that and pursuing this line you right and not diminish the importance those geopolitical issues which spend you the vast amount focused and you write about and all interested and they extremely important the world and global security and peace and prosperity but talking about the united_states and not just those issues and our relationship has history was joking with the deputy foreign minister titov were were talking about the arctic and commented the fact that have thank then the empire for giving the united_states stake the arctic selling alaska right our relationship goes way when secretary state seward purchased alaska and made eventually the arctic council but shared laugh over that but just example over the united_states and have deal with each_other these political issues but broader level people people have stronger ties than did when was growing the and and people people ties educational and forth the political issues are challenging and maybe more challenging some ways than they were for predecessors years_ago when was the soviet_union versus the west and the united_states but any event keep talking about positive things like this give more space try work out the more difficult political issues thank_you very for this interview and looking forward talk with you some other issues maybe later because there were lot substantial things you conveyed very important for our people because they asymmetrically informed about the positions because they don understand how profound your access your job and your mission ambassador here thank_you konstantin look forward continuing this conversation hope person soon but not continuing through zoom look forward speaking again soon end october topics soyuz
